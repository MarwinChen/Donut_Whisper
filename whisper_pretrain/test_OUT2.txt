your condition is your duty (0007)
a cartoonist (0008)
yeah that is me (0009)
what is up (0010)
yeah it was my idea (0011)
some jerk at the airport gave me a hard time (0012)
i am not sure about it (0013)
1st i made it just a picture of a random muslim (0014)
then i thought what the hell (0015)
language (0016)
i mean if i am going to make a statement why not (0017)
you are not really making a statement you know (0018)
he was working at a place (0019)
so it was your idea to depict the prophet yeah (0020)
somebody had to do something or the fundies went (0021)
i emailed clay told him i wanted to talk (0022)
i did not want to change a cartoon (0023)
get other muslims to reexamine (0024)
i just started reading (0025)
to examine their preconceptions (0026)
and why do it anonymously (0027)
hey i am 15 years old why do i do anything (0028)
you have to find out (0029)
you have to understand (0030)
i knew nothing about any of this (0031)
and would you please . (0032)
would you be willing to testify about all of this direct (0033)
well i . (0034)
well he could testify in camera in the judge is chambers (0035)
i am reading it (0036)
there would only be the judge the lawyers the court reporters (0037)
missus florrick (0038)
missus shurma (0039)
i know the name of only one cartoonist (0040)
kurt westergaard (0041)
the man who drew one of the cartoons of muhammad (0042)
beautiful (0043)
that you paid for it 5 years ago (0044)
and he has been living under 24 7 (0045)
for our security since then (0046)
i will not do that to my son (0047)
you explained he could testify in camera (0048)
yes she does not want to take the chance (0049)
well if she does not produce it (0050)
previously on the good wife . (0051)
she will be held in contempt (0052)
no (0053)
we need him (0054)
he is the only one who can corroborate (0055)
the cartoon was his idea not yours (0056)
i already have jeff sanborn is blood on my hands (0057)
i will not have these kids (0058)
this kid is all we have charles (0059)
if we do not use him we need an alternate story for the jury (0060)
counter terrorism you know just finished his preliminary bombing report (0061)
maybe there is something we overlooked (0062)
can you get your hands on it (0063)
that he is worth thinking about (0064)
i can try (0065)
if i leave lockhart garden (0066)
i do not want it to be a dozen junior associates and me (0067)
well here you go (0068)
we have got an equity partner (0069)
there is no condition (0070)
10 associates (0071)
you got an equity partner (0072)
there is a lot of unhappiness at lockhart gardner (0073)
which one (0074)
$450000 (0075)
i like your hair messy (0076)
do not come at us (0077)
10 litigators an unhappy equity partner (0078)
it is julius is not it (0079)
is not it he was always close to stern (0080)
you are a smart boy (0081)
he tried to poach you (0082)
stern did yes (0083)
and 11 others (0084)
who is there (0085)
the only name i know is julius cain (0086)
i do not want you to think for one moment (0087)
i was considering taking it (0088)
of course not (0089)
i am a team player (0090)
i just want to do what is right for the firm (0091)
thanks cary yeah (0092)
0 and i am working on your loan (0093)
i think we can make it work (0094)
thanks (0095)
i really appreciate that (0096)
yes i was at the vindicator (0097)
when mister clay made the decision to publish the car (0098)
no money could ever replace your husband (0099)
and did you argue against it (0100)
i felt it was insensitive to muslim believers (0101)
especially when the same point could be made (0102)
without depicting muhammad (0103)
you also argued that it was reckless (0104)
i was the reporter on the synagogue baham (0105)
i saw the devastation that caused (0106)
mister thiessen were you present when mister clay met (0107)
with a vindicator lawyer prior to the publication of the cartoon (0108)
objection (0109)
attorney kline privilege of service (0110)
mister theson observes the conversation your honor (0111)
and is not covered by the privilege (0112)
that makes sense to me (0113)
does not it ms lockhart (0114)
i will allow (0115)
what was said at this meeting (0116)
your reference to the new york times (0117)
and yale university press decision not to reprint the danger (0118)
he believed in both cases (0119)
the fear of inciting violence trump the public is need to know (0120)
but the only way we can talk here is about money (0121)
thank you sir (0122)
mister thiessen you were working (0123)
i am worried that the paper would be insensitive (0124)
to religious believers by printing the cartoons (0125)
yes (0126)
i am not a muslim myself but i can sympathize (0127)
and what is this (0128)
piss christ (0129)
i am sorry i could not hear you (0130)
can you (0131)
yes an artwork depicting a crime (0132)
the crucifix placed in a cup of urine (0133)
this photo illustrated an article (0134)
of yours on controversial arts (0135)
i am sorry (0136)
my goodness why not the same sensitivity to religious power (0137)
bye (0138)
because that is unlikely to incite violence (0139)
so it is not about sensitivity it is about fear (0140)
it is about business (0141)
you were fine (0142)
i will be damned if i am going to have to (0143)
you were hired from the vindicator were not you mister lewis (0144)
and as part of mister clay is cost commitment (0145)
yes but that has nothing to do with my testimony (0146)
who are you (0147)
the plumber who are you (0148)
they were reading a lot of books about grief (0149)
i am jackie (0150)
that means nothing to me (0151)
peter is mother (0152)
0 yes (0153)
of course missus florrick i am i am eli gose (0154)
please come on in (0155)
you are not the plumber (0156)
no (0157)
i suggest waiting 6 months before you make any business (0158)
i am peter is image consultant (0159)
call me at ui (0160)
i like that broach (0161)
thank you where is mine (0162)
hi son he just . (0163)
he is meeting with his pastor (0164)
his pastor (0165)
in your life well . (0166)
the police (0167)
please go in i am sure they would love to say hello (0168)
yeah it was good (0169)
we had a guide and a porter (0170)
and his sister was in a . (0171)
jeffrey died exactly 6 months ago this week so . (0172)
they would be meeting once a week for proof (0173)
in prayer spiritual guidance (0174)
and the sharing of jesus christ (0175)
who is that man (0176)
isaiah east of the street (0177)
pastored lord in christchurch (0178)
on 95th (0179)
yes (0180)
south side (0181)
there is something in the fbi report (0182)
the theory is that the bomb was tossed in through the window (0183)
just like the synagogue (0184)
but all the windows were blown out by the force of the blast (0185)
so so there is no way to tell if the bone was tossed in or not (0186)
i know (0187)
that is the last site you remember what place it is (0188)
those dumb waiters they used during prohibition to haul the liquor up (0189)
they are all over the place (0190)
so this is the access to the office do not we (0191)
well the blast blew at him (0192)
it does not mean it went up this way (0193)
people think that jonas stern is losing his mind (0194)
what what is it (0195)
you are fired (0196)
kalinda words (0197)
the bomb was hydrogen nitrate (0198)
a liquid explosive (0199)
and it stains concrete not tireless (0200)
how do you know that i looked it up (0201)
look (0202)
and you are too (0203)
the stain spotted here not here (0204)
concrete not tile (0205)
i could have come down the shaft from the blast (0206)
not in the good form (0207)
so what are you saying sir (0208)
someone mixed the bomb here (0209)
and raised it on the dumb weighter (0210)
i am not saying anything i am just staring at a stain (0211)
but if the bomb was mixed here (0212)
talking about an insight (0213)
this is sanborn if you do this we have to start over (0214)
the blast blew apart the wall with a dumb waiter (0215)
so there was no evidence that it was even there (0216)
should i bring julius in on this (0217)
no no no no yeah we will update him later (0218)
i still do not understand how the feds missed this (0219)
yes yes they did not (0220)
their investigation is still open (0221)
they are just an issue in any of their findings (0222)
and they will not until they catch you ever responsible (0223)
cary come on in (0224)
the question is what does it mean (0225)
well stern is theory is that clay wanted a violent backlash (0226)
that rests on the fact that he cut back security (0227)
no security officer (0228)
security would have been able to prevent it (0229)
and we may not get a better settlement from our client (0230)
stern will still argue that the bomb was planted by a radical islamic group (0231)
they just had help from inside (0232)
so talk to the employees (0233)
that could help (0234)
a lone bomber in the office (0235)
how many muslim employees does he have (0236)
can not be many (0237)
so we are going to mutually profile (0238)
the exact thing the cartoon was against (0239)
we are going to step nicely past the ironing (0240)
and defend our client (0241)
go over the employees for the last 5 years (0242)
i will . (0243)
okay (0244)
i will wait (0245)
julius can we talk to you for a 2nd (0246)
why why do you think that is a good thing (0247)
what is that about (0248)
it is a betrayal (0249)
what happened to loyal people (0250)
guilty (0251)
it exited the building the day you fired half of tax litigation (0252)
look (0253)
i really did not want it to get back to you this way (0254)
because i just talked to a lawyer (0255)
it is no secret this place is going well (0256)
through financial troubles (0257)
half of which is stern is fault julius (0258)
it was just trouble before stern started to take clients (0259)
he hired a new lawyer (0260)
right now his firm seems more stable (0261)
why would i consider him a mentor (0262)
but at the end of the day i bet on myself not him (0263)
it is all about stern (0264)
i am sorry (0265)
julius (0266)
you are one of the best lawyers we have (0267)
you have a great client list (0268)
so what is it going to take (0269)
we offer from stern (0270)
0 . (0271)
we can match it (0272)
what about gearing up that diversity program (0273)
we do not have (0274)
behind virtually every other major chicago firm (0275)
in diversity hiring (0276)
0 i missed you baby doll (0277)
i am tired of being the poster boy for affirmative action around here (0278)
okay fine (0279)
we will find her money (0280)
all right (0281)
now it is your turn to do something for us (0282)
10 other lawyers who are going to go with you (0283)
their names (0284)
what you want me to . (0285)
hey get out of here (0286)
but now they will stay (0287)
stern wanted me not them (0288)
with access to proprietary information (0289)
you are going to fire them (0290)
it is more money for diversity hiring (0291)
write down the names (0292)
come work for a real law firm (0293)
what is that the result of my questioning the employees (0294)
the week before the attacks (0295)
told me they did not take this to clay (0296)
they took it to clay and he ignored it (0297)
which makes it even worse that it was an inside job (0298)
clay is not liable for unforeseeable acts of his employees (0299)
if he had prior notice (0300)
if we know this stern knows this (0301)
well that is a happy thought (0302)
that is me mister chair (0303)
well it makes clay is questioning tomorrow that much more important (0304)
you have done wrong (0305)
which brings up another problem (0306)
julius was handling questioning (0307)
why is that a problem (0308)
no (0309)
i have arrived (0310)
alicia (0311)
she can get in stern is face more effectively (0312)
in fact did you know something about stern no one else knows (0313)
you can not use it kalinda (0314)
you can not not use it (0315)
it violates attorney client privilege (0316)
i will see if you tell someone so do not tell someone (0317)
thank you for joining us missus sanborn (0318)
please (0319)
i want you to meet bishop grayson (0320)
mom (0321)
the most nice episcopalian priest he will have (0322)
i want to help you put this religion stuff into perspective (0323)
that is not perspective (0324)
this is about alicia is not it no (0325)
it is an extreme and unconditional pleasure (0326)
no it is not it is about me (0327)
and i need to change (0328)
you do not peter (0329)
you are a good man (0330)
you want to blame yourself (0331)
and you apologized (0332)
you apologized again and again (0333)
anybody who wants another apology from you (0334)
only wants you to be weak so stop it (0335)
i love this (0336)
stop this now (0337)
the son will not be made weak (0338)
you are one scary mom (0339)
yes and you are a good son (0340)
missus sanborn stated under oath (0341)
it was your decision to have the cartoon depict the prophet muhammad (0342)
that is untrue (0343)
the cartoonist contacted me with that idea (0344)
still it was your decision to run the cartoon mister clay (0345)
i know i have (0346)
why did you (0347)
because it was newsworthy (0348)
it was not sensational (0349)
and this is america (0350)
hello julius (0351)
we can handle it (0352)
thank you (0353)
mister clay (0354)
that is the naked columnist (0355)
an advice columnist in my paper (0356)
who supposedly answers questions in the news (0357)
i see you have not taken down the s yet (0358)
that is newsworthy (0359)
that is not sensational (0360)
and he is not on the front page (0361)
and this is america (0362)
you can handle it (0363)
i am the the naked columnist (0364)
for entertainment in every paper (0365)
a lot of room apparently (0366)
you devoted 10000 column inches to the naked columnist last year (0367)
and how many of you devoted to iraq (0368)
we were looking for a new stern (0369)
i am battling internet competitors sir (0370)
competitors who were willing to give away their product for free (0371)
mister clay are you aware that the police now believe (0372)
this bombing was an inside job (0373)
objection not in evidence yes (0374)
coffee 2 sugars (0375)
your honor this is plaintiff is exhibit n (0376)
the police report filed yesterday morning (0377)
good things (0378)
mister clay you do not know anything about this (0379)
objection argumentative (0380)
your honor it is a simple leading question (0381)
overruled (0382)
how about your 3 anybody want coffee (0383)
you may answer i am sorry (0384)
what was the question (0385)
the question was . (0386)
the police now believe that the bombing was an inside job (0387)
the bomb was hoisted up through a door (0388)
objection again (0389)
it is in the investigative report (0390)
the investigative report merely states (0391)
that it appears a bomb was planted from inside (0392)
it does not say anything specifically about dumb waiters (0393)
we ask that statement be stricken from the record (0394)
ah just be one coffee (0395)
is really necessary missus florrick (0396)
overruled (0397)
you are on (0398)
your marriage is in trouble (0399)
where was i (0400)
right right (0401)
the employer (0402)
so mister clay (0403)
how are you feeling mister stern (0404)
have any of your employees approached you about threats (0405)
objection overly vague (0406)
missus florrick (0407)
you are right (0408)
withdrawn your honor (0409)
you may proceed mister stern (0410)
yes thank you your honor (0411)
 one moment (0412)
mister stern (0413)
yes just one moment please thank you (0414)
the inside job the threat (0415)
the document (0416)
i have other questions for this witness (0417)
give me a minute (0418)
how am i feeling (0419)
i am sorry your honor (0420)
i i just . (0421)
i . (0422)
i have nothing further (0423)
thank you mister clay you are dismissed (0424)
well i am feeling like amending a complaint (0425)
please refrain from speaking with the jury (0426)
and make yourself available for further questions (0427)
at this time (0428)
i suggest a a 10 minute recess (0429)
no i do not understand (0430)
and you are still treating this like it is jihad even though it is an inside job (0431)
was it the threat the bomb (0432)
look (0433)
we were talking about racial profiling right (0434)
what if someone was using our bias to make us think it was jihad (0435)
when it was really something else (0436)
how does that sound (0437)
okay (0438)
i am listening (0439)
and . (0440)
that is all i got (0441)
i did not say i was solving something (0442)
i just said i did not understand (0443)
because you do not acknowledge true repentance (0444)
i want credit for it (0445)
the insurance has been capped at $350000 (0446)
whatever you get i want credit (0447)
whatever (0448)
mister thiessen you cover the bombing at the oakland synagogue (0449)
that is right (0450)
it is your opinion that this bomb was very similar to that one (0451)
identical (0452)
in both cases the device was fashioned from a metal (0453)
densely packed with hydrazine nitrate explosives (0454)
than a simple remote traggered circuit (0455)
but this utilized a different triggering mechanism (0456)
the synagogue bombing (0457)
the newspaper can not pay anymore (0458)
no (0459)
it was identical (0460)
a modified flash blown yes (0461)
it is quite clever (0462)
this is just enough flame to trigger the fuse (0463)
that is interesting (0464)
but when you reported on the synagogue by the way (0465)
mommy you never mentioned that fact (0466)
it is kind of a technical detail (0467)
on the scope of a basic news article (0468)
unless it was an intentional act (0469)
of course (0470)
it is just that whoever planted the bomb at the vindicator (0471)
you know the layout of the building (0472)
mister samborn is schedule and how to build a house (0473)
to build a bomb exactly like the defenders of allah (0474)
objection your honor (0475)
there has not been a question yet (0476)
and if you do not mind (0477)
if you never reported on the triggering mechanism (0478)
the only person who is out there (0479)
intentional act opens you up to punitive damages (0480)
the person i can think of who possesses all of that knowledge would be you (0481)
objection your honor (0482)
it is completely without basis (0483)
i am afraid you are right i have to sustain it (0484)
to sustain that objection (0485)
well that is okay your honor (0486)
but we have nothing further (0487)
i love when she talks like that (0488)
missus florrick thank you (0489)
thank you for visiting (0490)
peter thanks (0491)
master this is zach and grace (0492)
well thought (0493)
what else is for (0494)
would you ever like to talk sometime (0495)
2 of us (0496)
no (0497)
i have respected the way you stood by your husband (0498)
sounds so good coming from a young person (0499)
lessening for parents (0500)
well it is a lesson in something (0501)
you told your boss (0502)
be imposed sure (0503)
and julius (0504)
i told you that in confidence (0505)
how is it an intentional act (0506)
stern found out i leaked (0507)
he fired me (0508)
no this weather coffee (0509)
why did you tell them (0510)
why did not you just come over he is stern (0511)
you seem like the loyal type (0512)
i do not know it is crazy huh (0513)
what about you (0514)
you are a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot like a lot (0515)
is there a job there (0516)
for who me (0517)
no (0518)
how you doing (0519)
the coffee was too hot to throw in your face (0520)
your client published an editorial cartoon (0521)
i am talking about the very essence of our faith (0522)
what does it mean (0523)
what does christian forbearance mean (0524)
when the apostle paul wrote in philippians chapter 4 verse 5 (0525)
let your forbearing spirit be evident to all (0526)
what did he mean by that (0527)
that we should tell our neighbor (0528)
i will put up with you (0529)
until you prove no (0530)
christian forbearance has no time limits (0531)
i am sorry (0532)
okay it is just us what is up (0533)
he has got me in a corner childs (0534)
the pick is the prophet muhammad (0535)
he has got stuff on me even you do not know about (0536)
and he will use it (0537)
unless you testify against me (0538)
peter i have no choice (0539)
being body scanned at an airport metal detector (0540)
i think the final challenge is going to make you lie on a stand (0541)
it is not all lies (0542)
about the videotape of us (0543)
you know the meeting in the hotel room (0544)
tell me what i have to do (0545)
do you believe in hell (0546)
do i believe in hell (0547)
and while all the other white passengers are away through (0548)
why (0549)
do you believe you have to answer for your sins (0550)
we do not have time to believe him (0551)
good job guys (0552)
actually i do yes (0553)
peter i am sorry (0554)
he threatened me (0555)
he threatened me he threatened everything (0556)
i will not even talk about the stuff i have on you (0557)
you are beyond caring about that (0558)
let us talk about the stuff i have on your son anthony (0559)
it was intended to criticize racial profiling (0560)
i saw him (0561)
that is right (0562)
your beautiful legacy . (0563)
peter do not (0564)
no you are a christian (0565)

0 there it is (0640)
that poker fit (0641)
you know i always thought the cia could do it (0642)
you could learn something from the suburban housewife (0643)
i understand the obligations of my job (0644)
good (0645)
0 has your friend will gardner stabbed you in the back (0646)
at 5 16 p m on september 5 the explosion hit (0647)
would you like me to get him on the phone for you you can ask (0648)

or does the name gerald kozko mean anything to you (0650)
he is a real estate developer (0651)
underwater (0652)
and unless i am mistaken his name keeps on going (0653)
is coming up in connection with your husband is case (0654)
always a pleasure missus florrick (0655)
well it is never about the mother (0656)
it is always about something else (0657)
i am sorry we can not help (0658)
take care (0659)
missus florrick (0660)
it was felt over 4 blocks away (0661)
mister . (0662)
kozko (0663)
gerald we have never met (0664)
how is peter (0665)
fine i did not know you knew (0666)
i do not i was shopping for my lawyers to join my defense team (0667)
but appears we have a conflict of interest (0668)
you (0669)
anyway . (0670)
federal investigators determined it was a pipe bomb (0671)
glad to meet you peter royce said he was a lucky guy (0672)
now i see why (0673)
would you tell peter something for me (0674)
tell them i am sorry (0675)
4 (0676)
and know what i mean (0677)
consisting of ammonium nitrate and anhydrous hydrozine nitrate (0678)
by a great grandfather lucius clay founded the vindicator (0679)
in his 1st editorial he endorsed abraham lincoln (0680)
the custody railed against prohibition (0681)
the trib and the sun times may be bigger (0682)
but they have to answer to corporate ownership (0683)
reuters (0684)
lucius set them up to shuttle in the booze (0685)
which had been thrown through the window of the newsroom layout office (0686)
so we gladly admit that (0687)
and committed this attack upon the blasphemers (0688)
how do you know how to get involved with this cartoon (0689)
to defend the honor of all muslims and of our beloved prophet (0690)
yes (0691)
yes i have seen this (0692)
please (0693)
the plaintiff says it is no secret this group has been active in chicago (0694)
6 months earlier they committed a death (0695)
and you had to know that is not a good thing (0696)
and if a cartoon might provoke them (0697)
the job is to provoke (0698)
because it sells papers (0699)
because freedom of the press is meaningless unless somebody actually (0700)
and he actually uses it (0701)
i am not trying to be insensitive (0702)
i know that sam borne was a very good friend (0703)
no culprits were ever apprehended (0704)
the problem is (0705)
well mister clay as their argument is (0706)
to get it to increase circulation (0707)
it is not like i commission this cartoon wholly (0708)
i was hoping it was going to anger muslims (0709)
best place to meet (0710)
to a political cartoon any subject (0711)
can you pick the cartoon (0712)
and the federal government continues to investigate (0713)
i am doing consultation with my editors (0714)
jeffrey sanborn too (0715)
sure of course (0716)
so even if stern can show he intended this to happen (0717)
what is the most contributory negligent (0718)
it is going to be a total win (0719)
i will get us back to the table (0720)
but more than mister clay is testimony to establish it (0721)
it was an anonymous interview (0722)
i sent them home to me (0723)
to a paypal account routed through a prop (0724)
it is no way to trace your name (0725)
we will see (0726)
i will get kalinda on it (0727)
the explosion killed the plaintiff (0728)
returning to the scene of the crime (0729)
you are not going to pout are you (0730)
go away (0731)
mister jeffrey samborn (0732)
bye (0733)
okay let us inspect the level of coincidence here (0734)
i have not seen you since college (0735)
you are confined to the apartment 24 hours a day (0736)
you are listening to each other here (0737)
i talk about the murder (0738)

the next day lo and behold (0740)
we are suing your firm we are suing my client (0741)
cary think about it (0742)
why let us slip a piece of information like that to you (0743)
to managing editor of the cook county vindicator (0744)
on the phone to your boss before our 2nd drink (0745)
i . (0746)
what is going on (0747)
i do not know (0748)
i will play stern why not (0749)
i am once here (0750)
stern wants me (0751)
like you wanted me now he wants me (0752)
lockhart gardner is going under (0753)
it is a hollowed out shell (0754)
in one year (0755)
your firm will be nothing (0756)
but an empty floor and an office building (0757)
objection (0758)
mister stern has got equity plenty of business (0759)
one more thing no contest (0760)
that is right you are a little contest with missus florrick (0761)
it resulted in his death (0762)
you got more business (0763)
and florrick . (0764)
stern you are on the line (0765)
the win is new (0766)
there is a better path to partnership (0767)
think about it (0768)
and i will be alone (0769)
0 i will not be alone (0770)
i am leaving lockhart gardner (0771)
you are reading us (0772)
noted and accepted (0773)
so where are we on getting me to church (0774)
i am filing a religious exception to electronic monitoring (0775)
but we will hope for the best (0776)

i am not getting a photographer at the charge (0778)
i do not care what the good pastor has to say (0779)
we are not doing that (0780)
what is it what is the matter (0781)
probably nothing . (0782)
childs is changing the direction with the retrial (0783)
at the sex angle what (0784)
that is all he has got (0785)
is he changing the trial date no 2 months away (0786)
mister samborn (0787)
i am sorry (0788)
i am hearing chatter about a surprise witness (0789)
so who can hurt you (0790)
well if they are going to lie anybody can hurt them (0791)
you are me (0792)
maybe charles is trying to quietly make this disappear (0793)
and i doubt it (0794)
how is it going (0795)
gerald kozko was at my office today (0796)
he wanted me to tell you something (0797)
i need to tell peter i am sorry (0798)
and has 2 wives (0799)
dan (0800)
no kozko and childs hate each other (0801)
well he was too (0802)
but if it is the only way to get peter we need . (0803)
i am sorry (0804)
who will suffer from law school (0805)

mister clarence (0809)
mister samborn (0810)
my husband have a close relationship with his employer (0811)
mister clay (0812)
until recently (0813)
it had become strained with her friendship (0814)
in the cook county vindicator jointly and several (0815)
well why was that (0816)
objection beyond the scope (0817)
well i really think we are safe here do not you (0818)
i . (0819)
answer missus semple (0820)
the paper was in financial trouble (0821)
it must not cross this line (0822)
they pay off a lot of staff (0823)
the press took its toll (0824)
it is also frustrated by mister clay is pursuit of a . (0825)
new yorker cover (0826)
like the obama bill (0827)
agree to pay julius (0828)
on the new yorker something like that (0829)
that would increase readership (0830)
well missus sanborn did your husband help mister clarence (0831)
wait choose a cartoon for publication in the paper (0832)
it was a comment (0833)
and he helped mister clay judge it (0834)
the cartoon that appeared was different was not it (0835)
yes (0836)
i saw the original (0837)
it did not depict muhammad (0838)
it was just a middle eastern man (0839)
jeffrey told me that the decision (0840)
to change it to mohammed was mister clay is (0841)
to reiterate more controversy (0842)
$250000 from capped business insurance (0843)
it is not just me (0844)
we need to find that cartoonist (0845)
so here is your cartoon (0846)
how it almost looked like (0847)
looks like bars (0848)
they can indicate a sense of suffocation (0849)
i do not want to say what they mean (0850)
in case it might indicate someone (0851)
to the muslim themselves (0852)
does this really hurt (0853)
what is your work (0854)
applied to join the party (0855)
it does of course (0856)
you know what you are looking for (0857)
you do not respect my job do you (0858)
it is best with the kids (0859)
you are out of comparison (0860)
you run an image search cross referenced (0861)
of the sample drawing . (0862)
it is still too much (0863)
by your location (0864)
chicago (0865)
$100000 from capped renters insurance (0866)
better (0867)
i am a believer (0868)

on payments cars (0872)
yeah i got my (0873)
on a condo in lincoln park interest rates are up (0874)
look the rates are still low (0875)
money is a little tight these days that is all (0876)
i just want to know if there is anything i should do (0877)
i think i should be aware of (0878)
about your no (0879)
nobody is trying to get his hands on him (0880)
if we agree now we agree (0881)
he is not trying to tell you anything it is just money is tight (0882)
i am sorry (0883)
so i am still in the running you are (0884)
nobody is made any sense (0885)
how many decisions yet (0886)
excited (0887)
yes (0888)
so how is peter doing (0889)
yeah he is good i mean he would be a lot better (0890)

he got the message (0892)
missus anley (0893)
yeah look you and peter (0894)
i want peter to go back a long way (0895)
peter wants to have sex with you (0896)
he can help his friends in any way he can (0897)
you do not want to hurt peter (0898)
and i am born (0899)
it is not just me (0900)
to protect (0901)
i am the son (0902)
peter has a family too (0903)
okay let us go (0904)
whatever you have (0905)
or think you can do it (0906)
from a man who can be advised to hurt peter (0907)
there is twice as much to hurt you (0908)
i know your reputation mister gold (0909)

in his game (0913)
missus sanborn (0914)
they are giving him spiritual instruction (0915)
i am not going to church (0916)
you are having risk assessment mister gold (0917)
childs is a bigger risk (0918)
it is a good day to give you immunity (0919)
that is not good (0920)
i do not know (0921)
we do not threaten with a defense (0922)
just subpoena unless he refuses to testify (0923)
we are discussing . (0924)
how about we do not threaten at all (0925)
missus bechsher (0926)
where would they put her the mom (0927)
mchenry detention general detention (0928)
the middle of a population of cook county (0929)
they make it a shell game (0930)
that you could find her (0931)

your run has lived in america for 27 years (0954)
for the microphone madam (0955)
missus verma has demonstrated good moral character (0956)
okay (0957)
she supports herself as a building manager and she would be subjected (0958)
i wanted to undo hardship (0959)
from her american born children (0960)
she more than qualifies for an adjusted residence (0961)
your honor i have a copy of it (0962)
okay (0963)
in the name of simmons application for a driver is license from the dmv (0964)
in the application she checked the voter registration box (0965)
thus making a false claim of citizenship a federal offense (0966)
these forms are confusing and often filled out by rote (0967)
your application clearly states (0968)
making a false claim is a serious federal offense (0969)
missus verma should be permanently inadmissable (0970)
as a citizen of the united states (0971)
her ties to america are very strong (0972)
too close for the microphone again madam (0973)
some rejudgment approved (0974)
since verma is deportation is approved (0975)
next case (0976)
your honor . (0977)

all i ask is that them all do is patriotic duty (0991)
help us bring down a major player (0992)
he does that you stop his mother is deportation (0993)
i am putting in a good word (0994)

you need to be nervous (1623)
they have a friend here (1624)

missus florrick is not it (1655)

and warned him he could get into trouble (1658)
we are trying to ascertain his connection to an identity (1659)
i had a theft ring (1660)
sumr on (1661)
i think you should invite these gentlemen to leave (1662)

if you do not want them here you can ask them to leave simo (1664)
gentlemen (1665)

i wonder if i can get it fitted (1689)
objection your honor (1690)
calls for speculation (1691)
the question asks mister hunter to guess the answer (1692)
to answer rather than rely on facts (1693)
yes that is a definition of speculation (1694)
congratulations ms florrick (1695)
mister bigelow too bad i did not do that (1696)
sustained (1697)
exception (1698)
noted and when you go to mock trial appeal court (1699)
you can argue it there (1700)
now mister hunter i just want to ask you (1701)
to understand the sequence of events (1702)
that you saw my clients entering the cottage (1703)
yes i was hunting in the forest when i heard a scream (1704)
actually you said screams (1705)
yes screens (1706)
you said that you recognized those as belonging to the witch (1707)
she lives in that gingerbread house (1708)
0 so you just assumed (1709)
that it was the witches scream coming from inside the oven (1710)
no i recognized her voice (1711)
ah so you have the power to distinguish between screens (1712)
how about this one (1713)
objection your honor (1714)
miss cabrini (1715)
sustained sustained what (1716)
that is the objection (1717)
badgering the witness (1718)

he wants the doctor to pull the plug (1892)
who knows you know (1893)
i do not want to deal with a lot of last minute maneuvering on this (1894)
like most creative geniuses (1895)
his deepest convictions changed hourly (1896)

mister gold in my office (1967)
so you are talking to (1968)
i am (1969)
play them into a card (1970)
one of the reasons we did not want this to be public knowledge (1971)
just because we did not want a lot of last minute politicking (1972)
again (1973)

when they put in the sign they left a hole in the wallet (2079)
thank you (2080)
we are like family right (2081)
i just heard something upstairs (2082)
i guess i can not let go (2083)
when max and i were in rehab (2084)
this is his 12 step quote i used to say (2085)
do not quit before the miracle happened (2086)
and you may say that it is a 1000000 to one shot (2087)
but max is life . (2088)
and he was becoming who he was (2089)
that was a 1000000 to one shot (2090)
max loved life (2091)
he loved action (2092)
he was going to skydive on his 80th birthday (2093)
so i know for a fact that he would never want this (2094)
i am sorry (2095)
there is a good chance that the state is attorney will not prosecute peter (2096)
but he has gone (2097)
caroline (2098)
you know we both love him (2099)
but he is . (2100)
this is torturing him (2101)
is that the tax report (2102)
yep (2103)
you are not going to have to see her (2104)
what are you thinking about (2105)
i had him checked for drugs and alcohol (2106)
but they already . (2107)
i did not find anything (2108)
for other foreign substances (2109)
mister wilder ingested ethylene glycol (2110)
and freeze (2111)
because of kozko suicide (2112)
that is why the drunk in appearance (2113)
we are opening up a murder investigation (2114)
is the prime suspect (2115)
why (2116)
a $40000000 motive for one thing (2117)
hi (2118)
where is the rest (2119)
why are not you answering my calls (2120)
because i am in a relationship (2121)
i do not believe you (2122)
not with that case (2123)
look i know you have vulnerability issues (2124)
actually yes (2125)
i do not want to cuddle with you (2126)
i just . (2127)
that is all (2128)
purely recreational (2129)
and if that does happen (2130)
you go to somebody else for emotional validation (2131)
she is coming in today that is what i heard (2132)
drink your drink pay the bill (2133)
you can follow me out (2134)
and i will have to get on the same page quickly (2135)
what page is that (2136)
the toxicology report pinpoints (2137)
since the poisoning is happening between 10 0 a m and noon (2138)
when max was at the house (2139)
was not at max is house (2140)
do you have any proof (2141)
was this just before you went to court i do not know (2142)
i mean i i i guess so (2143)
trying to think (2144)
we least believe they have established motive caroline (2145)
to the campaign (2146)
so if you stand just right (2147)
now they are trying to establish access by putting you at the house (2148)
good train have been there (2149)
yeah i mean she has a key so i guess it is possible (2150)
do you really think that they suspect me (2151)
yeah (2152)
who is that (2153)
it is our savior (2154)
so mister jordan (2155)
mister stern and please (2156)
so vernon you have been looking us over i hear (2157)
i will not do interviews and i will not do photos (2158)
i love chicago (2159)
at 5758 i drove the city bus (2160)
really (2161)
best buses in the world (2162)
my 1st big city experience (2163)
well i do not think we would be speaking out of turn (2164)
say we are happy to be looked over (2165)
and i respect that my children will not either (2166)
we are hoping you can open some doors for us to washington (2167)
well it is the new economy (2168)
we all have to diversify (2169)
so after your tire kicking what do you think vernon (2170)
i think the firm lacks focus (2171)
it seems as if you are taking cases on a whim (2172)
i think you have nailed our vulnerability (2173)
more passion sometimes than sense (2174)
will and i know that we need a referee (2175)
that we would be willing to offer a 3 way split (2176)
i i am sorry i thought . (2177)
i want to buy you out (2178)
if i could be so bold . (2179)
is that not what you want (2180)
no you can not right (2181)
well that did not go well (2182)
who would have thought our firm means more without us than with us (2183)
really undercuts one is confidence (2184)
got it (2185)
it is time to make some tough decisions (2186)
everything going on in the conference room (2187)
and you were not here (2188)
no (2189)
you never went to his house (2190)
anyway that is not why i am here (2191)
no (2192)
and who has keys to his house (2193)
well i am not completely sure (2194)
j (2195)

my client gets the rest of the estate and full guardianship (2216)
of a comatose patient (2217)

and let me know (2397)
we need to answer it for you (2398)
anybody else (2399)
good (2400)
do we understand we have reached an agreement (2401)
yes your honor (2402)
mister childer as acquiesced to a divorce (2403)
in a signed divorce agreement (2404)
i am sorry mister childer where is he (2405)
your honor my guess is (2406)
that was in fact mister wilder calling (2407)
well it is unfortunate you did not answer it before court counselor (2408)
i could ask for a 30 minute recess your honor (2409)
to ascertain mister wilder is whereabouts (2410)
face . (2411)
we have no problem with that your honor (2412)
mister kreutzer in my courtroom (2413)
this time will be respected even by rock stars (2414)
you have 5 minutes to locate him (2415)
when i do my thing you do yours (2416)
5 minutes (2417)
what happened (2418)
next world it was just in a motorcycle accident (2419)
is is he all right (2420)
no we see the comms (2421)
can not you believe it (2422)
the only difference is mine makes money (2423)
quick just going to have a fit (2424)
margie shh shh just listen (2425)
you made notes on the wilder prenup (2426)
on power of attorney (2427)
we could get half (2428)
he stays in a coma $40000000 state (2429)
you are killing me (2430)
you need to tell her (2431)
no we need to make her filthy rich 1st (2432)
12nd (2433)
it is a bad economy david that is all (2434)
margie now (2435)
we are good (2436)
what did you do your honor . (2437)
you already have a divorce agreement (2438)
we are riding this ship (2439)
it is not signed we do not have it properly signed (2440)
hey stop it the both of you (2441)
where is mister wilder (2442)
your honor he is in a coma (2443)
but this divorce is done (2444)
in our rush to get to the court on time i am afraid (2445)
then write it (2446)
we may have overlooked it very late (2447)
the last page of the divorce agreement (2448)
i am sorry (2449)
sorry (2450)
<empty> (2451)
<empty> (2452)
i have no love for this place (2453)
you do not understand (2454)
has turned into a $40000000 divorce (2455)
no it is just me and alicia (2456)
i need troops (2457)
and i will take litigation (2458)
i do not want to jump to harbor and green unless i have to (2459)
max wilder was just in a motorcycle accident (2460)
in a coma (2461)
you are kidding no (2462)
and our client controls his $40000000 stay (2463)
if he stays in a coma (2464)
here is the rub (2465)
david is looking at the will (2466)
our guess is he wrote our client out (2467)
so if he dies she gets nothing (2468)
just the prenup (2469)
so we are cheering for him to stay in a coma (2470)
effectively (2471)
they are like ghouls (2472)
as long as we are solving ghouls (2473)
i do not like boxes (2474)
0 what do you think of vernon jordan (2475)
what do i think of vernon jordan (2476)
yes was a 3rd partner (2477)
0 i is that a possibility (2478)
we are bringing in a 3rd partner (2479)
he has been sniffing around us (2480)
looking for an opening into chicago (2481)
well that would be a lifesaver (2482)
we would not have to make cuts (2483)
i will try to set up a meeting (2484)
i will take any support i can get cary (2485)
margie said he is coming in for a divorce settlement (2486)
i need you on the wilder divorce (2487)
but it became important (2488)
yeah yeah yeah sure sure anything (2489)
i will head off right away (2490)
i heard about this messiah partner (2491)
i did not say anything (2492)
0 my god (2493)
they just swerved into oncoming traffic (2494)
for 2 months now can not wait (2495)
i always hate with that thing (2496)
alicia this is j ben san (2497)
i am a legal services manager (2498)
alicia is my lawyer (2499)
i do not know (2500)
maybe i should not be here (2501)
he talked about you caroline just last week (2502)
you could help us (2503)
no we did not (2504)
do not try to make me feel better (2505)
it looks so simple (2506)
$3400000 in kawaii (2507)
collect on overdue accounts (2508)
$5500000 on the properties in chicago (2509)
you can use your cell phone in here (2510)
that is a meth right (2511)
he is in with missus wilder (2512)
missus (2513)
the helmet protected the frontal and temporal bone (2514)
but the base of the helmet snapped back (2515)
in seeing severe trauma to the cerebellum (2516)
we have stopped the bleeding but . (2517)
yes that is our problem (2518)
i am sorry (2519)
a subdural hematoma (2520)
which means . (2521)
missus waldo your husband is effectively brain dead (2522)
i am sorry (2523)
not dead dead (2524)
hey excuse me (2525)
who i am his wife you divorced him (2526)
she did not (2527)
doctor are you saying that mister wilder can never be revived (2528)
effectively yes (2529)
i look at contracts all day long (2530)
when i start making collection calls to my divorcees (2531)
when i see the word effectively (2532)
i know it means no (2533)
sir is not a contract (2534)
with this massive loss of brain tissue (2535)
for one in a 1000000 likelihood he would revive (2536)
a 1000000 to one means life (2537)
and wife needs to be cherished in treasury (2538)
what other value did we hold higher (2539)
sir the only thing keeping mister wilder alive is a machine (2540)
since he is already dead (2541)
doctor (2542)
you have another associate (2543)
no (2544)
they bow to another firm before i can hang up (2545)
i had a patient (2546)
he fell off a ladder in 1988 (2547)
and he ended up in a persistent vegetative state (2548)
i made the same speech that i just heard in there (2549)
and then 21 years later he just woke up (2550)
i do not know any other way to say it (2551)
he woke up from a 21 year sleep (2552)
he was a one in a 1000000 shot (2553)
and yes science and medicine deal in repeatable phenomena and not this (2554)
give us till the end of the week (2555)
but i do not make that speech anymore (2556)
shane has filed a petition for legal guardianship (2557)
so she can unplug macs (2558)
she can file all she wants (2559)
that is not what i thought of (2560)
my guess is kreutzer argues in 10 (2561)
and carillon initialed all but the last one (2562)
missing page of a divorce settlement (2563)
good job by the way alicia (2564)
that is what i like to hear (2565)

we had a moment (2594)
i am phoning to check everybody is temperature (2595)
the ceo was just accused of murder (2596)
everybody else scramble (2597)
not necessarily the buyer is motivated money is money (2598)

alicia i do not have a fairy godmother (2621)
over the whole chicago political machine (2622)

but i had to make money for this firm (2624)
and that is just not enough (2625)
sir you have to leave (2626)
i need my laptop and my personal items (2627)
you can itemize them and they will be collected (2628)
i collected and sent to your home (2629)

i need them now (2631)
that is not possible sir (2632)
will be returned to you within 3 working days (2633)
i just want to compare them (2634)
this was not fair (2635)
and i was stupid i acted like a would be (2636)

be at peter florrick is hand yes (2667)
i heard from a butterfly it would not be (2668)
both are hearsay statements your honor (2669)
your turn is not just a morbid thing (2670)
the peter smith family (2671)
the innocent law allows for exactly such hearsay testimony (2672)
it . (2673)
for hearsay as long as a murder is established (2674)
is established here because there is no . (2675)
there is a hearsay statement that establishes it (2676)
when the snake actually devours its tail okay (2677)
your ridiculing established illinois law (2678)
that is who you are (2679)
i worked legally (2680)

hysterical prosecution (2711)
45 years (2712)
there is a copy of the victim is diary (2713)
some very interesting entries on your client (2714)

you could underline the parts through to fiction (2742)
do not worry (2743)
i had said . (2744)

if you were to pretend to break in and handcuff me (2746)

alicia i am taking responsibility for your irresponsibility (2796)
are you visiting someone else in the building mister gold (2797)
i was but i thought i would make a little detour (2798)
i can not talk about any ongoing investigation (2799)
0 i did not think he could (2800)
i thought i would talk about him knock yourself out (2801)
glenn childs has it out from my client (2802)
it is a politically motivated project (2803)
and the fbi should not be in the business of taking sides (2804)
you are reading too much into my visit with mister childs (2805)
he is giving you evidence against you (2806)
he is suggesting that florrick is responsible for kozko is death (2807)
and you are buying it (2808)
well you know you are a secret investigation (2809)
let me see your phone (2810)
my client is no longer a secret (2811)
i have seen this (2812)
i know you have but you have not seen it on the side of a bus (2813)
and i had it made into buttons (2814)
one for each of the reporters visiting the court (2815)

you think this will scare us mister golden (2818)
the office that took down capone (2819)
really (2820)
0 i know how the fbi works (2821)
you do not like to hunt for namagem (2822)
you would rather take down an already bleeding (2823)
because you want to look good for your superiors (2824)
well this is just to say that we are not bleeding (2825)
we have a lot of fight left in us yet (2826)

that is sweet new one is it ever good (2830)
i got the results of the dog necropsy (2831)
no drugs in chile that is not all (2832)
that was blood on the dog is fur from the victim is bed (2833)

just fled when she broke in (2835)
nope she did not call herself in breaking in (2836)
it is from the struggle (2837)

control shift and d (2910)
no f (2911)
actually ms tassioni i i am a little busy (2912)
for clients (2913)
yes the problem is i lack confidence with computers (2914)
do this another time (2915)
did you know missus kozko has 3 children (2916)
anthony lisa and arthur (2917)
i did not (2918)
anthony is the oldest places the middle child (2919)
damn (2920)
control c (2921)
well arthur is the youngest (2922)
yes arthur is the youngest (2923)
now mister and missus kozko (2924)
placed $45000 in all of their accounts for college (2925)
look i wrote a letter (2926)
very nice day (2927)
and this money is a lot of money (2928)
was not to be touched until the graduate school (2929)
from high school well . (2930)
well anthony already graduated from college so he spent his . (2931)
and lisa is in college now (2932)
so she is halfway through her spending (2933)
you really missed daniel golden (2934)
and arthur . (2935)
arthur did not start spending his college money until this year (2936)
2 weeks ago to be specific (2937)
okay (2938)
the thing is arthur is not in college (2939)
in fact arthur was a stillborn birth in 1992 (2940)
well when the obama white house calls you got to go (2941)
now that is funny yes (2942)
and that got me thinking (2943)
who is withdrawing all this money from his bank account (2944)
i am just losing my mind (2945)
funny you should ask (2946)
to a trial bank and trust in savannah (2947)
no did you know (2948)
you know there is another savannah in the cayman islands (2949)
i did not know that (2950)
interesting is not it (2951)
so how are you ahead of the police on this (2952)
they are not looking (2953)
golden said she is the better litigator (2954)
you seem to be down one partner today (2955)
and i am wearing a different tie (2956)
what is that matter (2957)
we want involuntary manslaughter 5 years (2958)
with 4 day time off that is 3 days (2959)
for a brutal sexual homicide (2960)
i got a 2nd degree 15 years (2961)
it is a 24 hour clock on it (2962)
it is just easy to underestimate her (2963)
never expires tomorrow (2964)
we have proof that sweeney was stocked (2965)
at least stipulate the victim stalked him (2966)
agreed he was stocked so . (2967)
in our stalker statutes on the books (2968)
statutes that my husband instituted when he was in office (2969)
and your point missus florrick (2970)
talk to your boss (2971)
what sort of message would he be sending (2972)
stalking victims if swiney is prosecuted (2973)
well she must be very very good because i . (2974)
are you really trying to blame the victim defense with colin sweeney (2975)
offer him 10 years and we do not have to go to trial (2976)
and let me talk to my boss (2977)
where is diane (2978)
on a chinese wall (2979)
i am greatly underestimating her (2980)
criminal and acquisitions (2981)
the merger yes (2982)
it is my guess (2983)
probably more lucrative if somebody is out of the picture (2984)
that is when he takes a plea he can be removed as ceo (2985)
does sweeney know about this (2986)
he knows that we represent his criminal and financial interests (2987)
yes (2988)
fagin lot is love the murderer (2989)
on death row (2990)
sheila corresponded with him (2991)
before sweeney (2992)
you know i thought i recognized those entries in our diary (2993)
like the ones sweeney said were fiction (2994)
they were from the fagens trial (2995)
the court reporter (2996)
i am checking all of her trials now (2997)
what other killer she corresponded with (2998)
where are you going (2999)
0 julius this could get the (3000)
i have known him down from 10 years (3001)
ms tassiani hi (3002)
hey hey how is that chinese wall (3003)
eli gold (3004)
missus florrick (3005)
yeah as much as i like keeping our working relationship collegial (3006)
you are a junior associate (3007)
and i am an equity partner (3008)
watch your tone (3009)
yes sir i will (3010)
0 yes hello (3011)
i think we should reconsider the plea bargain (3012)
kalinda is found new evidence (3013)
what evidence sheila warburg she stalked other killers (3014)
so you think he is innocent (3015)
no (3016)
i think he is innocent of this (3017)
you are not good with computers are you (3018)
i am ready to hear missus kozko is testimony miss tassiano (3019)
yes just one last objection your honor (3020)
the peterson law as atrocious as it may be . (3021)
objection sustained (3022)
it requires that mister florrick not only profit from a murder (3023)
to be the instrument of that murder correct (3024)
are you asking me ms tassioni (3025)
my son keeps buying me new ones (3026)
no but you can answer if you want to (3027)
and you can get to the point (3028)
okay well for mister kozko (3029)
one key thing is to avoid murder (3030)
is required that we overlooked (3031)
and what is that miss tassioni (3032)
may he be dead (3033)
i did it (3034)
and just backing away and laughing (3035)
this is an atm photo taken a week ago (3036)
at bcp bank trust in savannah cayman islands (3037)
your honor missus kozko is hearsay testimony is inadmissable (3038)
and because kozko is video proffer is likewise inadmissable (3039)
there is going to be a very simple reason that mister kozko is still alive (3040)
why please (3041)
it is done (3042)
be free (3043)
linda (3044)
so what are we watching evidence (3045)
so your boy is free (3046)
my boy (3047)
florrick he just won (3048)
really yeah (3049)
so i hear there are some tapes (3050)
0 there are always some names (3051)
and i hear that they heard childs and florrick (3052)
so neither wanted to use them (3053)
mutually assured destruction (3054)
sounds like a fairy tale (3055)
for the retrial yep (3056)
plenty how fairy tales turn out to be true (3057)
here is the thing kalinda (3058)
this is not about childs or florrick thinks (3059)
this is about childs and florrick (3060)
we are investigating them both (3061)
and i just do not want you to get hurt (3062)
thank you for your concern (3063)
the prosecution lost its only witness right (3064)
i am your friend here (3065)
it is good to know (3066)
so you would advise me to take this (3067)
it is the best deal we could have made (3068)
8 years (3069)
and this is after we started (3070)
with what i would have said was an adamant 45 (3071)
missus florrick (3072)
it is true (3073)
they started with 45 years (3074)
kozko committed suicide so they do not have a case (3075)
and why not court (3076)
it is coming down to perceptions mister florrick (3077)
we would have filed for a change of venue but . (3078)
and famous everywhere (3079)
yes (3080)
they liked me here in prison (3081)
i am like the king of kings (3082)
and i thought monday would be a simple matter of a dismissal (3083)
it is not unlike getting the best table at schwab actually (3084)
same jockeying for position (3085)
we have until 6 0 to take the plea (3086)
okay thank you julius (3087)
i i i need to talk to missus florrick for a 2nd (3088)
you are working together (3089)
i understand (3090)
i just have a piece of gossip i want to share please (3091)
watch (3092)
it is about the merger yes (3093)
the company means more with me out of the picture (3094)
and . (3095)
can i get better than 8 years (3096)
yeah (3097)
and if we go to trial (3098)
i do not know (3099)
kayla warburg has stalked other killers (3100)
but i do not know if that is enough to overcome your . (3101)
your baggage (3102)
here (3103)
yes it is quite fun (3104)
wow (3105)
i did tell my wife (3106)
i guess the universe is having its little joke at my expense (3107)
you killed her (3108)
in your face (3109)
thank you (3110)
thank you for being honest (3111)
prosecution interview (3112)
you are welcome (3113)
well . (3114)
people be peter florrick (3115)
off i go (3116)
peter was pretty bold about it (3117)
it is over is not it (3118)
looks like it (3119)
zach is drinking champagne (3120)
zach soda (3121)
$45000 would buy you a certain amount of access (3122)
do you know these people (3123)
some (3124)
i like me (3125)
so what are we going to do (3126)
well clean up (3127)
well after that . (3128)
0 i do not know (3129)
what do you want to do (3130)
by a big house (3131)
go to europe (3132)
could not have done it without you (3133)
no that is not true (3134)
it is the women is day initiative (3135)
we smile we comfort we nurse (3136)
yes but we are always there (3137)

this is michael from the afl cio (3146)
and he is looking for a very good chicago based law firm (3147)
who works for lockhart co (3148)
she is one of their best lawyers (3149)
if i do say so myself (3150)
so why do not you 2 talk (3151)
to allow a payment on a bigger house (3152)
this is a video proffer completed by mister kozko before his death (3153)
the prosecution now plans to introduce it into evidence (3154)
but they can not because of trs (3155)
that is right (3156)
they do not want to use it they want to talk (3157)
and he is trying to get the press to use it (3158)
that was my 1st guess but . (3159)
these are not the motions of a prosecution winding down (3160)
peter promised me an year (3161)
and i also promised me his friendship (3162)
come on everybody join the happy couple on the dance floor (3163)
go no (3164)
it will feel the same way about you (3165)

hello (3281)
is someone else here no (3282)
here comes the cavalry (3283)
he never hurt anyone (3284)
chilled you barely even barked (3285)
so you are saying she killed your dad (3286)
even though the victim was arrested (3287)
has no defensive wounds on her body from a canine attack (3288)
mister sweeney is choosing not to answer at this time detective (3289)
missus florrick (3290)
you said that your fingerprints were on . (3291)
on the doorbell on the entering doorknob (3292)
on the banister . (3293)
on the camera (3294)
can we open the back of the camera (3295)
i can not answer that due to attorney client privilege (3296)
but your fingerprints are on the camera (3297)
yes as i said (3298)
so you are still insisting that you did not tamper with evidence (3299)
yes even though i smell alcohol on your breath (3300)
do not worry (3301)
this is my job ms sharma (3302)
i do not interfere with your job (3303)
we were celebrating when i received a phone call from mister sweeney (3304)
excuse me for mister gardner (3305)
a partner at my firm (3306)
he told me to come here to collect contracts (3307)
i arrived by cab i did not drive myself (3308)
you are under arrest for murder mister sweeny (3309)
back in the cuffs i go (3310)
listen to me mister sweeney (3311)
remained silent (3312)
irony does not work here (3313)
jokes do not work (3314)
do you understand (3315)
you have the right to sign a bill (3316)
anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law (3317)
all rise (3318)
you have a grand cycle of resentment (3319)
good morning (3320)
as the youngest justice on the bench in the state of illinois (3321)
i would like to say welcome (3322)
and i believe you have a motion mister state is attorney (3323)
i do your honor (3324)
and as we move to introduce into evidence (3325)
made by our key witness gerald kozko recently deceased (3326)
yes your honor (3327)
hi i hate to object right off the bat (3328)
but the key word here is deceit (3329)
mister florrick has a right to challenge his accuser (3330)
i can not cross examine a dead witness as much as i would like to do (3331)
your honor (3332)
2 years ago illinois legislature in a 109 . (3333)
to 0 vote past the peterson law which makes us (3334)
in the state of the union which allows hearsay evidence such as this proffer (3335)
to accuse benefits from the death (3336)
ah getting novel on us mister chatham (3337)
childs this law is almost as new as i am (3338)
yes your honor (3339)
but unfortunately for mister childs (3340)
that peterson law requires the accused benefit not just from his appeal (3341)
but from a murder he committed (3342)
and mister kozko committed it (3343)
the police have not made that determination your honor (3344)
has been found in a private apartment (3345)
and we will present evidence to the contrary (3346)
they fired him (3347)
i am sorry (3348)
my apologies your honor i am sorry (3349)
mister childs would like to prove my client is a murderer (3350)
so he can prosecute him for corruption (3351)
well that is certainly his (3352)
will novel or not novel (3353)
we will hear evidence on this alleged murder tomorrow (3354)
they kept you (3355)
the guy who seemed to be here might want to keep track of mister florrick (3356)
yes she is talking with the feds (3357)
i got a client last minute through peter (3358)
i think things just got more serious (3359)
coordinating strategies (3360)
i do not know (3361)
hi are you 2 coordinating strategy (3362)
mister childs and our old friends (3363)
0 what a relief (3364)
she would ambush me (3365)
and if i won we would have sex (3366)
she was your stalker but you encouraged her (3367)
it was a game (3368)
she would break in i would disarm her we would have sex (3369)
that was terrific (3370)
this time it was different (3371)
this time she tried to kill me (3372)
the police are calling the victim a jane doe (3373)
do you have any idea who she was (3374)
no i just knew her as sheila pam (3375)
you said she wrote it (3376)
yes classic stalker letters (3377)
where are they (3378)
in his bedside table (3379)
which means the police already have it (3380)
let us petition the court for access to these letters (3381)
no (3382)
when do we get forensics (3383)
look preliminary 3 days (3384)
you should get an expedited necropsy on the dog (3385)
i think that is a culboussack (3386)
you got a minute (3387)
preliminary me reform (3388)
no defense on the victim from a canine attack (3389)
yes but sweetheart (3390)
he said he heard no barking at all when the jane doe broke in (3391)
so maybe the attackers sedated the dog (3392)
that would show up in a nikrumpsey (3393)
cary would have done it (3394)
and if we can prove jane does sedated the dog (3395)
she went there with the purpose of doing harm (3396)
good it is a place to start (3397)
get the letters and get the dog (3398)
alicia do you have a 2nd (3399)
you have done the same thing if you had that opportunity glenn (3400)
i am sorry (3401)
i did not know i thought it was contrary (3402)
i never would have sent you there (3403)
well really it is fine (3404)
how you handling it (3405)
the body of the blood (3406)
good (3407)
i did not really think about it (3408)
what a weird life we lead huh (3409)
i do not know (3410)
so are we normal again are we dealing with it (3411)
are we talking about the crime scene now (3412)

the 2 agency wide budget cuts the fbi (3427)

and nisq abhini (3431)
i do not know who that . (3432)
wait i do know who that is (3433)
the 4th richest man in europe right (3434)
not that we are counting (3435)
so men freak out about that (3436)
only the ones who are uncomfortable with sex (3437)
they have their own masculinity yeah (3438)
see you senor (3439)
what is your most expensive bottle of wine (3440)
it is very selective with its federal witness protection monies (3441)
so there is no pressure in this (3442)
it is just a deposition (3443)
they are polite and uncomplicated (3444)
we are just going to want basic information (3445)
no one is trying to score points (3446)
thank you (3447)
all right good (3448)
cary everything all right (3449)
alicia hi how are you (3450)

very elegantly put (3463)
hi (3464)
how much money did your husband make last year (3465)
last year (3466)
i do not know (3467)
my guess would be $55000 (3468)
and is it true that you took a vacation in in tigua last february (3469)
unfortunately for my purposes i will need more specificity (3470)
yes (3471)
do you remember how much it costs (3472)
$8545 in change (3473)
that madam is over 15% of your husband is yearly son (3474)
i work too (3475)
yeah part time as a nurse (3476)
that is an additional $23000 to eat (3477)
just to save you time (3478)
we would stipulate that the jury (3479)
to mister arkin is involvement in the task force is crash (3480)
yes (3481)
thank you missus florrick (3482)
i know that you would stipulate but i am looking to itemize (3483)
now let us turn to your domestic dispute charges against your husband (3484)
cue to the state is attorney (3485)
show some unexpected wit (3486)
cary is a good lawyer (3487)
you think we made the wrong decision (3488)
not necessarily (3489)
is part of a joint meeting (3490)
let us see how well he does against us (3491)
well it is carried in here (3492)
working for the opposition (3493)
smart (3494)
he is drawing blood too (3495)
he was a task force with the cook county sheriff is office (3496)
look i have some thoughts about finding this secret stash (3497)
good i could help us with the settlement (3498)
keep us informed (3499)
mister daily called (3500)
he said he wanted to call peter before the murder (3501)
but he was too busy (3502)
i knew exactly but he . (3503)
would you excuse me a 2nd time (3504)
i am looking for us (3505)
mister what was it again (3506)
goldman gold (3507)
missus florrick hello (3508)
and was pressured to participate in illegal activities by other people (3509)
i thought you might be able to help me with a little problem (3510)
but this is not really the place (3511)
yes unfortunately this is a time sensitive matter regarding your son (3512)
peter is questioned (3513)
to wait 4 years before running (3514)
no he is not (3515)
i am sorry he is (3516)
and if we do not file by the end of the day (3517)
the week will be forced to wait 4 years (3518)
to other members of his drug task force (3519)
you are not lying (3520)
no (3521)
i am sorry i wish i were (3522)
patrick isaiah talk to him (3523)
who introduced him to this pastor (3524)
i did but not without intention (3525)
mister gold there is one thing you need to know about my son (3526)
all these activities cross state lines (3527)
he is easily moved (3528)
you need to pre screen the people who see him (3529)
and i will talk to this man (3530)
plan on making the announcement by the end of the week (3531)
thank you (3532)
are you good mister gold (3533)
is willing to help the fbi bring these corrupt cops to justice . (3534)
am i good (3535)
i am the best man (3536)
i will need you to be (3537)
i shall know (3538)
objection (3539)
the plaintiff is counsel has an ongoing relationship with the expert witness (3540)
that seems more like a reason you should not hire him (3541)
then i should not question him (3542)
i am preserving my objection for trial (3543)
mister mcphee (3544)
and save his own ass (3545)
on tuesday last did you conduct an experiment (3546)
duplicating the april 16 officer shrews (3547)
i did (3548)
and this experiment was conducted at your farm (3549)
there was (3550)
in your barn (3551)
yes and this experiment (3552)
i just wanted to know too if you talked to your conclusion that the police investigation was accurate (3553)
that is correct (3554)
are you familiar with the fbi standards for a ballistic investigation (3555)
i am (3556)
was this investigation in your barn in accordance with those standards (3557)
okay maybe this was a mistake (3558)
in most respects (3559)
so in some respects it was not (3560)
that would follow (3561)
so that would be a yes (3562)
you are correct (3563)
the assailants firearm was lowered through the use of a c stand (3564)
yes (3565)
and the fbi standards caution (3566)
that a c stand is not a steady base for a firearm (3567)
right or right (3568)
i believe that is correct (3569)
you believe (3570)
yes i believe (3571)
well then let us move on (3572)
and what other ways do your homespun (3573)
on investigative methods clash with fbi standards (3574)
do you need a minute mister mcbae (3575)
i understand internal affairs is investigating this task force (3576)
i am sorry (3577)
what are you looking for (3578)
these cell phone photos leave a date and time (3579)
there (3580)
saturday march 13 (3581)
why do not you just let them do their work (3582)
how does that help you (3583)
do you have your credit card bills (3584)
the state is attorney wants to be reelected (3585)
i am not going to let an investigation happen (3586)
of his pet project become an embarrassment (3587)
i need to get into a storage locker (3588)
see how much fun it is being a fed (3589)
24 hour court orders (3590)
thank you (3591)
thanks (3592)
and what about the people in this room who could benefit (3593)
here we go (3594)
where you going (3595)
lockhart gardner (3596)
something in your mind (3597)
let me see your phone (3598)
why (3599)
i want to see who you are phoning (3600)
i am such an embarrassment (3601)
no (3602)
why (3603)
because i do not like to be questioned (3604)
mister arkin said there were 3 other corrupt cops (3605)
so we immediately put them under surveillance (3606)
this is you with the detective anthony burton (3607)
2 hours after our proffer (3608)
one hour before mister arkin was murdered (3609)
and here you are (3610)
10 minutes later in his car (3611)
so (3612)
so kalinda (3613)
there are only 5 of us in that room for that profit (3614)
and one of us leaked (3615)
no (3616)
0 so that is why these photos are so important (3617)
this one of me in the car (3618)
0 the arkeins came to you it is your case (3619)
that chose me leaking (3620)
it shows you in a compromised position (3621)
you are the man (3622)
with a correct cop (3623)
and yet i phoned you to tell you about this dash did not i (3624)
which i would not do if i were compromised (3625)
true (3626)
i guess i could just be confused (3627)
good job kalinda (3628)
anything you can find to tie it to the task force would help (3629)
are you all right (3630)
you sound like you have been running (3631)
okay (3632)
something special (3633)
just an $8000 bridal of wine (3634)
what (3635)
an $8000 bottle of wine (3636)
anyway to mine missus florrick (3637)
sawyer kept man these days hey (3638)
and where can i (3639)
i think it is better to avoid any appearance of a conflict (3640)
you just said the opposite (3641)
no i did not madam (3642)
and i do not understand (3643)
well i can not help you with that (3644)
look we found your stash location (3645)
you saw the police investigative report (3646)
you saw the crime scene photos (3647)
so how did mister arkin is saliva end (3648)
he went up on the landing 2 feet away from his body (3649)
why do not we take a break (3650)
do you have an answer mister hunter (3651)
you say you did not touch the bus (3652)
so how did he end up on his back (3653)
i want to confer with counsel (3654)
if that will help you get to the truth (3655)
sure (3656)
okay no problem (3657)
mister hunter would like to adjust his testimony (3658)
adjust (3659)
let us adjust (3660)
i did move jack arkin is body (3661)
then why did you do that sir (3662)
the jack was shot and fell face forward (3663)
by then after firing upon and killing mister gorman (3664)
preceded to turn jack over onto his back (3665)
because he was wearing a wire trying to nail us (3666)
where is this wire (3667)
we gave it to an eternal affairs (3668)
this wire will be supplied to you at the end of the business (3669)
to stay today (3670)
and guess what lady (3671)
that wire that was supposed to catch us (3672)
it shows this thing went down exactly the way we said (3673)
so i will be waiting for your apology (3674)
you know what i would do if i were you alicia (3675)
i would prepare for a season of losing (3676)
so they are saying this supports their version of events (3677)
i hate to say it but i think it does (3678)
no does not matter if it supports it (3679)
what do you mean (3680)
look at the incident report (3681)
gorman was lying in wait gun in hand (3682)
and within seconds of arson coming through the door (3683)
gorman was firing (3684)
so it was a setup (3685)
well the task force (3686)
the person you are arcing was the 1st one through the door (3687)
they did not need to kill arkin (3688)
they just needed gorman to do it (3689)
okay and wrongful death is wrongful death (3690)
so let us look at gorman (3691)
did someone contact him check phone records (3692)
in common with hunter (3693)
please forgive the lateness people (3694)
get started (3695)
just come right in (3696)
there you go (3697)
and grab a seat and make yourselves a at home (3698)
there you go there you go (3699)
missus florrick (3700)
aster isaiah (3701)
how are you hello (3702)
what can i do for you (3703)
you can leave my son alone (3704)
why do not you come in (3705)
you say you are a man of god (3706)
then stop making him feel this way (3707)
what way is that map (3708)
like he is a bad man (3709)
he is a bad man (3710)
i am a bad man even you missus florrick (3711)
who do you think you are (3712)
you think you know people (3713)
alicia right yes (3714)
you just used the same words with everyone (3715)
you you you were just saying (3716)
and you think you can make people feel bad about themselves (3717)
yes missus florrick your son approached me (3718)
he asked advice from me (3719)
i will continue to offer that advice (3720)
and i will do everything in my power to stop you (3721)
you do not know my son (3722)
this is a phase you are a phase (3723)
are you waiting for someone (3724)
then we will see (3725)
no you will see (3726)
he is running this year (3727)
he is my blood and i do not know what your god does (3728)
but it does not match that (3729)
0 will they told me i could wait down here (3730)

we are never getting out (3732)
let us do it (3733)
the 1st time we met (3734)
it was a pool party was not it (3735)
and doctor anation or what are they called (3736)
no orientation (3737)
it was a midnight pool party (3738)
well he will be a while (3739)
about a 100 law students trying to impress each other (3740)
mother did you swim (3741)
no i was too shy (3742)
you were the one doing cannonballs (3743)
god that is so embarrassing (3744)
it was not at the time (3745)
so what did you think of me (3746)
hello (3747)
ah no (3748)
you are okay (3749)
what (3750)
dangerous conversation (3751)
well now you have to tell me (3752)
come on i will tell you what i thought of you (3753)
so giata seems sweet (3754)
well there is a segue (3755)
yes she is sweet (3756)
and 3rd year at depaul (3757)
yes she is just getting her retainer in (3758)
you are not from college right (3759)
so is it always going to be this way between us (3760)
i want to say yes (3761)
but i want to know what you mean (3762)
just talking (3763)
depends yes (3764)
being casual and what (3765)
i like myself around you alicia (3766)
i do not like myself around a lot of people (3767)
how old 30 years (3768)
you do (3769)
it is an act (3770)
it is perfected over a millennium (3771)
do not answer it (3772)
it is just life again (3773)
yes and that is why i have to (3774)
hello (3775)
he is out here in law school (3776)
kalinda what is up (3777)
no i am just with will (3778)
no (3779)
okay i will meet you there (3780)
hi (3781)
kalinda got the dealer gorman is phone records (3782)
the night of the shooting (3783)
he had 2 calls from a hank landau (3784)
hank liddell who is hank liddell (3785)
no idea (3786)
glinda checked no priors (3787)
got a meter there (3788)
it looks a lot about you almost makes me jealous (3789)
okay (3790)
nice dinner (3791)
it was worth the wait (3792)
we always have options alicia (3793)
i am just saying (3794)
and we have no idea who hangcadell is (3795)
or why he was urgently phoning a meth dealer (3796)
do not be (3797)
an hour before he killed a cop (3798)
it does not look like an addict is house (3799)
i do not think there is a look to an addict is house (3800)
what were you doing with will (3801)
having dinner (3802)
okay (3803)
thank you for waiting (3804)
mister liddell is right this way (3805)
that is very unlikely (3806)
hank has some good days (3807)
but his arthritis keeps him from dialing the phone (3808)
and you have never heard him talk about a man named gorman (3809)
no (3810)
who else has access to the phone (3811)
here any of us (3812)
no i am kidding (3813)
us (3814)
nursing care (3815)
hank has 24 hour nursing care (3816)
i have the graveyard shift (3817)
is there any way to find out who was the nurse on duty (3818)
the night of the killing april 15 (3819)
that was trish (3820)
trish arkin (3821)
did i say something wrong (3822)
i am not kidding you (3823)
no it is just that is the wife of the deceased (3824)
so our client did it (3825)
she apparently warned the meth dealer (3826)
that her husband was coming to arrest him (3827)
how did she even know him (3828)
apparently through the husband (3829)
and the rest of the task force (3830)
innocent (3831)
well we do not know that for sure (3832)
but it does look like it was just arkin (3833)
who was dashing the weapons and the drugs (3834)
he realized internal affairs was looking into him (3835)
so he thought he would make a deal and turn on his partners (3836)
and trish (3837)
she was a battered woman (3838)
did not want to enter witness relocation with her husband (3839)
well that explains the league (3840)
when we counted who was in the room we did not count the wife (3841)
yep (3842)
and you want to hear an even greater irony (3843)
cook county wants to avoid embarrassment (3844)
they just made us an offer to drop the case (3845)
how much (3846)
i have a 1000000 (3847)
so trish gets her husband killed blames the police (3848)
that makes a cool half mill (3849)
are we taking it (3850)
well i do not think we can get them any higher (3851)
no i mean are we taking anything (3852)
she is guilty and she will get off (3853)
she is our client (3854)
it is our job (3855)
and at what point is our job wrong (3856)
when it fails our client (3857)
so let us advise our client to to accept the offer (3858)
you said i was a hunter (3859)
it is brad (3860)
so i seem to be a suspect (3861)
apparently internal affairs is looking into my case (3862)
in connection with the arkand shooting (3863)
yeah her (3864)
this stuff seems to be coming from your lawsuit (3865)
that is right (3866)
let us file the questions (3867)
but what i do for friends . (3868)
what you thought i did it (3869)
he is still on the bed (3870)
yeah (3871)
go to hell (3872)
the dash is the meth (3873)
what (3874)
what (3875)
nothing to just . (3876)
i am sorry (3877)
and folly he removes the guns (3878)
what is this (3879)
who really tipped off gorman (3880)
is that proof (3881)
want to like a check (3882)
so is this just an exoneration victory lap (3883)
or is he going to announce (3884)
gail you will find out in one hour (3885)
0 come on (3886)
is missus florrick going to be on stage though (3887)
excuse me (3888)
this is gold (3889)
i do not know (3890)
they are not going to leave us alone the press (3891)
you are right (3892)
you know i was reading about these murals in siena (3893)
and one of them showed good government (3894)
people happy (3895)
building is going up (3896)
courts making a good decision (3897)
and on the opposite wall was bad government (3898)
was the same people but they were . (3899)
they were unhappy (3900)
the court for making bad decisions (3901)
it occurred to me (3902)
but it only works if people step up (3903)
if you made the sacrifice (3904)
look i was just an okay state is attorney (3905)
nothing special (3906)
but i want to be a great one (3907)
and i can not do it without you (3908)
i do not want the kids involved (3909)
they will not be (3910)
and i want to work (3911)
and i want you to work (3912)

and apologize to the public and to my family (3917)

i was just thinking i do not want to go through life (3928)
you think something did not happen just cause i did not make myself clear (3929)
i can not hear you (3930)
i said i want to make something clear (3931)
hold on (3932)
to pull those charges to brock (3933)
that puts me back where i belong (3934)

i have the press (3949)
they are just waiting for a whiff of a new scandal (3950)
and i have a husband (3951)

thanks (4042)
i noticed you were on the scene (4043)
yes sir (4044)
it is my turn (4045)
i am a client (4046)
officer down at 3003 on the drive (4047)
stop (4048)
thank you officer dad (4049)
i am sorry (4050)
kalinda you can not be here (4051)
out out and out (4052)
i will tell you (4053)
we got an officer to jack on (4054)
i repeat get the check off there is no one to be walking (4055)
in his meth house and the shot came out of nowhere (4056)
i am on the stairs (4057)
i am a lawyer (4058)
i have been following him around for 6 months (4059)
he took the fire he took him down (4060)
he was jacked through the door alone (4061)
i went through the door alone we were there (4062)
you are not fast enough right (4063)
excuse me for a 2nd (4064)
i am sorry are you really blaming me for this leak (4065)
within 24 hours of our proffer our client was dead (4066)
yes and we are very saddened (4067)
but we can still get these corrupt cops off the street (4068)
by giving you this dashed location (4069)
unfortunately he never gave the location to us (4070)
okay (4071)
let us just chalk this up as a bad 1st date (4072)
i am sorry to ask you this now (4073)
but you know our firm wants to file suit against cook county (4074)
in the city of chicago for wrongful death (4075)
yeah they found (4076)
i just do not want anyone to think i am profiting from this (4077)
we worry internal affairs will bury this (4078)
because it is embarrassing to the state is attorney (4079)
give us a chance to investigate it (4080)
by bringing a lawsuit (4081)
yeah (4082)
so you think i should do this (4083)
i think bureaucracies are often prompted to action by the threat of money (4084)
the task force was targeting meth labs (4085)
their story is that arkin came through the door 1st (4086)
and then was shot by a meth dealer randy gorman (4087)
arkin ended up on his back here (4088)
then the rest of the task force returned to fire killing gorman (4089)
but there is an inconsistency (4090)
lab found jack is blood mixed with his saliva (4091)
2 feet from the body here (4092)
it is suggesting (4093)
that he fell faced 1st onto the landing (4094)
then someone flipped him over onto his back (4095)
it was staged (4096)
only ballistics i am on it (4097)
okay so our story is this (4098)
the task force discovered jack was going to testify (4099)
killed gorman (4100)
then eusegorman is going to kill jack (4101)
yeah let us finish this off in depositions (4102)
cook county will not want this in the press (4103)
you are hot on this (4104)
i am friends with a lot of cops (4105)
the bad ones hurt the good ones (4106)
so this is a crusade (4107)
it is a job (4108)
and a job will do well (4109)
we have to turn off cell phones and beepers (4110)
notice i am here as an invited guest (4111)
now that i am a client of your firm (4112)
yes (4113)
welcome (4114)
do you mind if i am blunt missus florrick (4115)
always a pleasure (4116)
i bought my business here i did not have to (4117)
do you mind if i am blunt mister gold (4118)
you brought your business here because we are a good firm (4119)
and let us both agree on one thing right now (4120)
you do not expect me on call (4121)
there is a statute of limitations on playing that card (4122)
fair enough (4123)
this is mimi collins (4124)
a 24 year old art student at whitley (4125)
2 years ago she was raped and brutally beaten (4126)
by her ex boyfriend and michael placido (4127)
20 minutes at the most (4128)
well if this is a criminal matter (4129)
mister gold you can take it upstairs (4130)
no it is more of an allegory (4131)
placido was sentenced to 20 years in prison (4132)
by the state is attorney at the time your husband (4133)
mimi collins went back to college (4134)
a happy healthy coed with nothing to fear (4135)
somehow i feel this will end badly (4136)
glenn childs in a general review of your husband is cases (4137)
argue that the placebo be released with time served that . (4138)
is mimi collins body (4139)
2 weeks ago in a chicago landfill (4140)
looks like your 1st ad campaign (4141)
it would be (4142)
if it were not for the fact that peter has decided to wait 4 years to run (4143)
really (4144)
he said that at dinner with you and the kids . (4145)
he was worried about the seductive allure of power (4146)
mister gold (4147)
who does the seductive allure of power sound like to you (4148)
that is right (4149)
the good pastor isaiah (4150)
i need you to talk to him (4151)
he thinks he is trying to restore your marriage (4152)
i am just telling you you do not need that (4153)
always good to see you mister golt (4154)
peter can not win without you (4155)
you know that (4156)
peter only wins with your good housekeeping steal of approval (4157)
i can not believe we are doing this (4158)
voters need to see you together (4159)
on that stage holding hands (4160)
goodbye mister gold (4161)
mister gorman got off 3 rapid shots (4162)
on the task force lead your client mister arker (4163)
all hit their target center too high one low (4164)
and this matches the crime scene (4165)
now my stairwell is 2 steps taller (4166)
i have adjusted by law and the c stand (4167)
and he will still turn back (4168)
now mister arkin fell as he was firing here on the landing (4169)
while another member of the task force (4170)
and fired 3 shots from here (4171)
you all right yes (4172)
what does it say about me that i find us exhilarating (4173)
you are human (4174)
and are we saying that the task force (4175)
and planted a drop gun on mister gorman or or was it his (4176)
it was his (4177)
well so how did this . (4178)
i mean are you saying . (4179)
i love you (4180)
you are saying it happened the way the police said (4181)
yes (4182)
it was not staged (4183)
that is correct (4184)
can the . (4185)
and the blood and saliva stain (4186)
you do not think mister arkin was flipped over onto his back (4187)
my guess is that in the extremity of the moment (4188)
one of mister arkin is partners (4189)
just turned him on his back to check his vitals (4190)
and they failed to report this during the investigation (4191)
you seem to accord the police a great deal of honesty (4192)
i do (4193)
and you brought me out here to what (4194)
your firm asked me to examine the evidence (4195)
well we have asked you that before and you just said no (4196)
that is true (4197)
that is because of my feelings for you (4198)
that i have shown you this (4199)
i will not bill you for the effort (4200)
you have feelings for me (4201)
i was approached by the state is attorney is office (4202)
to argue against our lawsuit (4203)
what are we doing the floors (4204)
yes (4205)
i declined (4206)
i think you should do what you want kurt (4207)
i think you should testify by the state is attorney is office (4208)
i would not hesitate to argue against you (4209)
what do you think about it (4210)
i will go get my purse (4211)
i know (4212)
so here we are (4213)
and i am treating (4214)
damn right you are (4215)
i ran into alicia florrick (4216)
huh where (4217)
at the office she seems nice (4218)
yes and a very talented lawyer (4219)
i am sure (4220)
i felt like i was intruding (4221)
you felt like you were intruding (4222)
i do not understand that (4223)
i felt like i was getting checked out by someone who had skin in the game (4224)
senorita gabrini (4225)
