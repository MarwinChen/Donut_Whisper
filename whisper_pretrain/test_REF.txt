doctor bassir may i help you (0001)
0 so sorry yes of course (0002)
is your husband home (0003)
my husband (0004)
my husband does not live in this country (0005)
is there a tarik bassir here (0006)
your condition is your defense (0007)
a cartoonist (0008)
yeah that is me (0009)
what is up (0010)
yeah it was my idea (0011)
some jerk at the airport gave me a hard time (0012)
so i drew about it (0013)
1st i made it just a picture of a random muslim (0014)
then i thought what the hell (0015)
language (0016)
i mean if i am going to make a statement (0017)
why not really make a statement you know (0018)
my husband (0019)
so it was your idea to depict the prophet (0020)
yeah somebody has to do something or the fundies win (0021)
fundamentalists i e mailed clay (0022)
told him i wanted to change the cartoon (0023)
put it out in the open get other muslims (0024)
he was working on a novel (0025)
to reexamine their preconceptions (0026)
then why do it anonymously (0027)
hey i am 15 years old (0028)
why do i do anything (0029)
you have to understand (0030)
i knew nothing about any of this (0031)
not until after (0032)
and would you be willing to testify about all of this tarik (0033)
that is not up to tarik (0034)
well he could testify in camera in the judge is chambers (0035)
i just started reading it (0036)
there would only be the judge the lawyers the court reporters (0037)
we would use a pseudonym (0038)
missus florrick miss sharma (0039)
i know the name of only one cartoonist (0040)
kurt westergaard (0041)
the man who drew one of the cartoons of muhammad (0042)
it is beautiful (0043)
in the danish paper 5 years ago (0044)
and he has been living (0045)
under 24 hour security since then (0046)
i will not do that to my son (0047)
you explained he could testify in camera (0048)
yes she does not want to take a chance (0049)
well if she does not produce him (0050)
previously on the good wife (0051)
she will be held in contempt (0052)
no (0053)
we need him (0054)
he is the only one who can corroborate (0055)
the cartoon was his idea not yours (0056)
i already have jeff sanborn is blood on my hands (0057)
i will not have this kid is (0058)
this kid is all we have charles (0059)
if we do not use him we need an alternate story for the jury (0060)
counterterrorism unit just finished its preliminary bombing report (0061)
maybe there is something we overlooked (0062)
can you get your hands on it (0063)
and you are telling me (0064)
i can try (0065)
if i leave lockhart gardner (0066)
i do not want it to be a dozen junior associates and me (0067)
it will not be (0068)
we have got an equity partner (0069)
there is no condition (0070)
10 associates (0071)
you got an equity partner (0072)
there is a lot of unhappiness at lockhart gardner (0073)
which one (0074)
that he is worth $350000 (0075)
i like your hair messy (0076)
do not comb it okay (0077)
10 litigators an unhappy equity partner (0078)
it is julius is not it (0079)
he was always close to stern (0080)
you are a smart boy (0081)
he tried to poach you (0082)
stern did yes (0083)
and 11 others (0084)
who (0085)
the only name i know is julius cain (0086)
i do not want you to think for one moment (0087)
i was considering taking it (0088)
of course not (0089)
i am a team player (0090)
i just want to do what is right for the firm (0091)
thanks cary yeah (0092)
0 i am working on your loan (0093)
i think we can make it work (0094)
thanks (0095)
i really appreciate that (0096)
yes i was at the vindicator (0097)
when mister clay made the decision to publish the cartoon (0098)
missus sanborn no money could ever replace your husband (0099)
and did you argue against it i did (0100)
i felt it was insensitive to muslim believers (0101)
especially when the same point could be made (0102)
without depicting muhammad (0103)
you also argued that it was reckless (0104)
i was the reporter on the synagogue bombing (0105)
i saw the devastation that caused (0106)
mister thiessen were you present when mister clay met (0107)
with the vindicator lawyer prior to the publication of the cartoon (0108)
objection your honor (0109)
attorney client privilege (0110)
mister thiessen observed the conversation your honor (0111)
and is not covered by the privilege (0112)
that makes sense to me (0113)
does not it ms lockhart (0114)
i will allow (0115)
what was said at this meeting (0116)
the lawyer referenced the new york times (0117)
and yale university press decision not to reprint the danish cartoon (0118)
he believed in both cases (0119)
the fear of inciting violence trumped the public is need to know (0120)
but the only way we can talk here is about money (0121)
thank you sir (0122)
mister thiessen you were worried (0123)
that the paper would be insensitive (0124)
to religious believers by printing the cartoon (0125)
yes (0126)
i am not a muslim myself but i can sympathize (0127)
and what is this (0128)
piss christ (0129)
i am sorry i could not hear you (0130)
piss christ (0131)
yes an artwork depicting a crucifix (0132)
placed in a cup of urine (0133)
this photo illustrated an article of yours (0134)
on controversial art (0135)
my goodness (0136)
why not the same sensitivity to religious believers (0137)
i am sorry (0138)
because that is unlikely to incite violence (0139)
so it is not about sensitivity it is about fear (0140)
it is about both (0141)
you were fired (0142)
i will be damned if i am going to have people think (0143)
from the vindicator were not you mister thiessen (0144)
as part of mister clay is cost cutting (0145)
yes but that has nothing to do with my testimony (0146)
who are you (0147)
the plumber who are you (0148)
i have been reading a lot of books about grief (0149)
i am jackie (0150)
that means nothing to me (0151)
peter is mother (0152)
0 yes of course (0153)
missus florrick i am i am eli gold (0154)
please come on in (0155)
you are not the plumber (0156)
no (0157)
and they all suggest waiting 6 months (0158)
i am peter is image consultant (0159)
call me eli (0160)
i like that brooch (0161)
thank you where is my son (0162)
he is just . (0163)
he is meeting with his pastor (0164)
his pastor (0165)
before you make any big changes in your life (0166)
but please go in (0167)
i am sure they would love to say hello (0168)
yeah it was good (0169)
we had a guide and a porter (0170)
and his sister was there (0171)
well jeffrey died exactly 6 months ago this week so . (0172)
they have been meeting once a week for prayer (0173)
spiritual guidance . (0174)
and the sharing of jesus christ (0175)
who is that man (0176)
isaiah easton (0177)
pastor at lord in christ church (0178)
on 95th (0179)
yes (0180)
southside (0181)
there is something in the fbi report (0182)
the theory is that the bomb was tossed in through the window (0183)
just like the synagogue yeah (0184)
but all the windows were blown out by the force of the blast (0185)
so so there is no way to tell if the bomb was tossed in or not (0186)
that is the blast site (0187)
you remember what clay said (0188)
those dumbwaiters they used during prohibition to haul the liquor up (0189)
they are all over the place (0190)
so this is the access to the office dumbwaiter (0191)
well the blast blew it apart (0192)
it does not mean it went up this way (0193)
that jonas stern is losing his mind (0194)
what what is it (0195)
you are fired . (0196)
kalinda words (0197)
the bomb was hydrogen nitrate (0198)
a liquid explosive (0199)
and it stains concrete not tile (0200)
how do you know that looked it up (0201)
look (0202)
and you are too (0203)
the stain splattered here not here (0204)
concrete not tile (0205)
well it could have come down the shaft from the blast (0206)
not in liquid form (0207)
so what are you saying (0208)
someone mixed the bomb here (0209)
and raised it on the dumbwaiter (0210)
i am not saying anything i am just staring at a stain (0211)
but if the bomb was mixed here . (0212)
we are talking about an inside job (0213)
missus sanborn if you do this we have to start over (0214)
the blast blew apart the wall with the dumbwaiter (0215)
so there was no evidence that it was even there (0216)
should i bring julius in on this (0217)
no not yet we will update him later (0218)
i still do not understand how the feds missed this (0219)
well my guess is they did not (0220)
their investigation is still open (0221)
they just did not issue any of their findings (0222)
and they will not until they catch whoever is responsible (0223)
cary come on in (0224)
the question is what does it mean (0225)
well stern is theory is that clay wanted a violent backlash (0226)
that rests on the fact that he cut back security (0227)
yeah but if the bomb came from inside (0228)
no security would have been able to prevent it right (0229)
and you may not get a better settlement from our client (0230)
stern will still argue that the bomb was planted by a radical islamic group (0231)
they just had help from inside (0232)
so talk to the employees (0233)
that could help (0234)
a lone bomber in the office (0235)
how many muslim employees does he have (0236)
can not be many (0237)
so we are going to racially profile (0238)
the exact thing the cartoon was against (0239)
no we are going to step nicely past the ironies (0240)
and defend our client (0241)
go over the employees for the last 5 years (0242)
i think i will (0243)
okay (0244)
shall we (0245)
julius can we talk to you for a 2nd (0246)
why (0247)
what is that about (0248)
it is a betrayal (0249)
it is a business decision (0250)
what happened to loyalty (0251)
it exited the building the day you fired half of tax litigation (0252)
look . (0253)
i really did not want it to get back to you this way (0254)
why do you think that (0255)
but it is no secret this place (0256)
is going through financial troubles (0257)
half of which is stern is fault julius (0258)
there was trouble before stern started to take clients (0259)
because i just hired a new lawyer (0260)
right now his firm seems more stable (0261)
and i consider him a mentor so do i (0262)
but at the end of the day i bet on myself not him (0263)
with stern it is all about stern (0264)
i am sorry (0265)
julius (0266)
you are one of the best lawyers we have (0267)
you have a great client list (0268)
so what is it going to take (0269)
here is my offer from stern (0270)
jeanette (0271)
we can match it (0272)
what about gearing up that diversity program we keep talking about (0273)
that will cost us money we do not have (0274)
we lag behind virtually every other major chicago firm (0275)
in diversity hiring (0276)
0 how i missed you baby doll (0277)
i am tired of being the poster boy for affirmative action around here (0278)
okay fine (0279)
we will find the money (0280)
all right (0281)
now it is your turn to do something for us (0282)
10 other lawyers who were going to go with you . (0283)
 their names (0284)
what you want me to . (0285)
ah good to see you (0286)
but now they will stay (0287)
stern wanted me not them (0288)
we do not want turncoats with access to proprietary information (0289)
you are going to fire them (0290)
it is more money for diversity hiring (0291)
write down the names (0292)
hey get out of this hellhole come work for a real law firm (0293)
what is that the results of my questioning the employees (0294)
one received that the week before the attack (0295)
tell me they did not take this to clay (0296)
they took it to clay and he ignored it (0297)
yes which makes it even worse that it was an inside job (0298)
clay is not liable for unforeseeable acts of his employees (0299)
but now if he had prior notice (0300)
if we know this stern knows this (0301)
0 well that is a happy thought (0302)
that is me mister cheer (0303)
well it makes clay is questioning tomorrow that much more important (0304)
you have done wrong (0305)
0 which brings up another problem (0306)
julius was handling questioning (0307)
why is that a problem (0308)
maybe cary should take it (0309)
i have arrived (0310)
no alicia (0311)
she can get in stern is face more effectively (0312)
the fact is you know something about stern no one else knows (0313)
i can not use it kalinda (0314)
you can not not use it (0315)
it violates attorney client privilege (0316)
only if you tell someone so do not tell someone (0317)
mister stern thank you for joining us (0318)
all right see you then (0319)
i want you to meet bishop grayson (0320)
mom (0321)
he is a nice episcopalian priest (0322)
he will help you put this religion stuff into perspective (0323)
it is in perspective that is not perspective (0324)
this is about alicia is not it no (0325)
missus sanborn it is an extreme and unconditional pleasure (0326)
no it is not it is about me (0327)
and i need a change (0328)
no you do not peter (0329)
you are a good man (0330)
you want to blame yourself (0331)
but you apologized (0332)
you apologized again and again (0333)
anybody who wants another apology from you (0334)
only wants you to be weak (0335)
so stop this (0336)
stop this now (0337)
my son will not be made weak (0338)
you are one scary mom (0339)
yes and you are a good son (0340)
missus sanborn stated under oath (0341)
that it was your decision to have the cartoon depict the prophet muhammad (0342)
that is untrue (0343)
the cartoonist contacted me with that idea (0344)
still it was your decision to run the cartoon mister clay (0345)
i know i have (0346)
why did you (0347)
cause it was newsworthy (0348)
it was not sensational (0349)
and this is america (0350)
hello julius (0351)
we can handle it (0352)
thank you (0353)
mister clay (0354)
what is the naked columnist (0355)
an advice columnist in my paper (0356)
who supposedly answers questions in the nude (0357)
i see you have not taken down the s yet (0358)
and that is newsworthy (0359)
that is not sensational (0360)
it is not on the front page (0361)
and this is america (0362)
we can handle it (0363)
the naked columnist (0364)
there is room for entertainment in every paper (0365)
a lot of room apparently (0366)
you devoted 10000 column inches to the naked columnist last year (0367)
do you know how many you devoted to iraq (0368)
we are looking for a new stern (0369)
i am battling internet competitors sir (0370)
competitors who are willing to give away their product for free (0371)
mister clay are you aware that the police now believe (0372)
that this bombing was an inside job (0373)
objection not in evidence yes (0374)
coffee 2 sugars (0375)
your honor this is plaintiff is exhibit n (0376)
the police report filed yesterday morning (0377)
thanks (0378)
mister clay you do not know anything about this (0379)
do you objection argumentative (0380)
your honor it is a simple leading question (0381)
overruled (0382)
how about you 3 anybody want coffee (0383)
you may answer (0384)
i am sorry wh what was the question (0385)
the question was . (0386)
the police now believe that the bombing was an inside job (0387)
that the bomb was hoisted up (0388)
through a dumbwaiter objection again (0389)
not in evidence it is in the investigative report (0390)
the investigative report merely states (0391)
that it appears a bomb was planted from inside (0392)
it does not say anything specifically about dumbwaiters (0393)
we ask that statement be stricken from the record (0394)
ah it will just be one coffee (0395)
is that really necessary missus florrick (0396)
overruled (0397)
thank you your honor (0398)
your marriage is in trouble (0399)
where was i (0400)
right right (0401)
dumbwaiter employees (0402)
so mister clay (0403)
how are you feeling mister stern (0404)
have any of the employees approached you about threats they might (0405)
have been receiv objection overly vague (0406)
missus florrick (0407)
you are right (0408)
withdrawn your honor (0409)
you may proceed mister stern (0410)
yes thank you your honor (0411)
 one moment (0412)
mister stern (0413)
yes just just one moment please thank you (0414)
inside job the threat a threat (0415)
mister stern the documents no no (0416)
do you have any further questions for this witness (0417)
damn it give me a minute (0418)
how am i feeling huh (0419)
i am sorry your honor (0420)
i i just . (0421)
i . (0422)
i have nothing further (0423)
thank you mister clay you are dismissed (0424)
well i am feeling like amending a complaint (0425)
please refrain from speaking with the jury (0426)
and make yourself available for further questions (0427)
at this time (0428)
i suggest a a 10 minute recess (0429)
you do not at all understand (0430)
we are still treating this like jihad even though it is an inside job (0431)
because of the threat the bomb (0432)
look (0433)
you were talking about racial profiling right (0434)
what if someone was using our bias to make us think it was jihad (0435)
when it was really something else (0436)
how does that sound jonas (0437)
okay (0438)
i am listening (0439)
and . (0440)
that is all i got (0441)
i did not say i was solving something (0442)
i just said i did not understand (0443)
because you do not acknowledge true repentance (0444)
i want credit for it (0445)
the insurance has been capped at $350000 (0446)
whatever you get i want credit (0447)
whatever (0448)
mister thiessen you covered the bombing at the oak lawn synagogue (0449)
that is right (0450)
and it is your opinion that this bomb was very similar to that one (0451)
identical (0452)
in both cases the device was fashioned from a metal canister (0453)
densely packed with hydrazine nitrate explosive (0454)
and a simple remote triggered circuit (0455)
but this utilized a different triggering mechanism (0456)
than the synagogue bombing (0457)
the newspaper can not pay any more (0458)
no no (0459)
it was identical (0460)
a modified flashbulb (0461)
yes from a camera it is quite clever (0462)
it produces just enough flame to trigger the fuse (0463)
0 that is interesting (0464)
but when you reported on the synagogue bombing (0465)
you never mentioned that fact (0466)
it is kind of a technical detail (0467)
a little beyond the scope of a basic news article (0468)
unless it was an intentional act (0469)
of course (0470)
it is just that whoever planted the bomb at the vindicator (0471)
had to know the layout of the building (0472)
the dumbwaiters mister sanborn is schedule (0473)
and how to build a bomb exactly like the defenders of allah is (0474)
objection your honor (0475)
objection there has not been a question yet (0476)
overruled (0477)
and if you never reported on the triggering mechanism (0478)
mister thiessen the only person i can think of (0479)
intentional act opens you up to punitive damages (0480)
who possesses all of that knowledge would be you (0481)
objection your honor (0482)
this is completely without basis (0483)
yes i am afraid you are right (0484)
i have to sustain that objection (0485)
well that is okay (0486)
your honor i have nothing further (0487)
i love when she talks like that (0488)
missus florrick (0489)
thank you for visiting (0490)
peter pastor (0491)
pastor this is zach and grace (0492)
welcome (0493)
missus florrick (0494)
would you ever like to talk sometime (0495)
just the 2 of us (0496)
no (0497)
i have respected the way you have stood by your husband (0498)
it sounds so good coming from a young person (0499)
it is a lesson in forbearance (0500)
well it is a lesson in something (0501)
you told your boss (0502)
about being poached sure (0503)
and julius (0504)
i told you that in confidence (0505)
how is it an intentional act (0506)
stern found out i leaked (0507)
he fired me (0508)
i know that is why the coffee (0509)
why would you tell them (0510)
why did not you just come over to stern is (0511)
you do not seem like the loyal type (0512)
i know (0513)
it is crazy huh (0514)
what about lockhart gardner (0515)
is there a job there (0516)
for who me (0517)
no (0518)
what are you doing (0519)
the coffee was too hot to throw in your face (0520)
your client published an editorial cartoon which depicts (0521)
i am talking about the very essence of our faith (0522)
take care (0523)
what does christian forbearance mean (0524)
when the apostle paul wrote in philippians chapter 4 verse 5 (0525)
let your forbearing spirit be evident to all (0526)
what did he mean by that (0527)
did he mean that we should tell our neighbor . (0528)
i will be right back (0529)
i will put up with you until you improve no (0530)
christian forbearance has no time limits . (0531)
gerry (0532)
okay it is just us what is up (0533)
he has got me in a corner childs (0534)
the prophet muhammad being humiliated (0535)
he has got stuff on me even you do not know about (0536)
and he will use it (0537)
unless you testify against me (0538)
peter i have no choice (0539)
being body scanned at an airport metal detector (0540)
you know childs is going to make you lie on the stand (0541)
it is not all lies (0542)
not the videotape of us (0543)
you know the meeting in the hotel room (0544)
tell me what i have to do (0545)
do you believe in hell (0546)
do i believe in hell (0547)
and while all the other white passengers are waved through (0548)
sure why (0549)
do you believe you have to answer for your sins (0550)
peter we do not have time (0551)
do you believe it (0552)
actually i do yes (0553)
peter i am sorry (0554)
he threatened me (0555)
childs threatened me he threatened everything (0556)
let us not even talk about the stuff i have on you (0557)
because you are beyond caring about that (0558)
let us let us talk about the stuff i have on your son anthony (0559)
it was intended to criticize racial profiling (0560)
your married son (0561)
that is right (0562)
your beautiful legacy peter (0563)
peter do not (0564)
do not you are a christian (0565)

a cost cutting measure (0604)
help me (0605)
if you are right help me (0606)
no (0607)
you once said (0608)
that everything would be fine if we just kept talking (0609)
read the settlement jonas (0610)
we can we can argue (0611)
we can fight but we have to keep talking (0612)
so there is nothing i can say (0613)
that is right (0614)
you know what happened in denmark (0615)
when the morning post published cartoons just like this (0616)
riots death threats (0617)
this is not about missus sanborn jonas (0618)
this is about us (0619)
of course it is about us (0620)
i am going to destroy your firm (0621)
and then i am coming back for the rest (0622)
and missus sanborn understands that do not you dear (0623)
i do (0624)
the transmitter is to be worn around your ankle at all times (0625)

missus florrick (0631)

how am i feeling (0633)
it was an innocent question (0634)
attorney client privilege (0635)
what you know about me (0636)
what you know about my condition (0637)
is for us to know and no one else (0638)
you do understand that (0639)
0 there it is again (0640)
that poker face (0641)
you know i always thought the cia could learn something (0642)
from the suburban housewife do you understand (0643)
i understand the obligations of my job (0644)
good (0645)
0 has your friend will gardner stabbed you in the back yet (0646)
at 5 16 p m on september 5 the explosion hit (0647)
would you like me to get him on the phone for you you can ask (0648)
ask him who he is meeting with right now (0649)
or does the name gerald kozko mean anything to you (0650)
he is a real estate developer (0651)
underwater (0652)
and unless i am mistaken his name keeps coming up (0653)
in connection with your husband is case (0654)
always a pleasure missus florrick (0655)
well it is never about the money (0656)
it is always about something else (0657)
well i am sorry we can not help (0658)
take care (0659)
missus florrick (0660)
it was felt over 4 blocks away (0661)
mister . (0662)
kozko gerald (0663)
we have never met (0664)
how is peter fine (0665)
i did not know you knew will (0666)
i do not i was shopping for more lawyers to join my defense team (0667)
but it appears we have a conflict of interest (0668)
you (0669)
anyway glad to meet you (0670)
federal investigators determined it was a pipe bomb (0671)
peter always said he was a lucky guy (0672)
now i see why (0673)
would you tell peter something for me (0674)
tell him i am sorry (0675)
for (0676)
he will know what i mean (0677)
consisting of ammonium nitrate and anhydrous hydrazine nitrate (0678)
my great grandfater lucius clay founded the vindicator (0679)
in his 1st editorial he endorsed abraham lincoln (0680)
in his last he railed against prohibition (0681)
the trib and the sun times may be bigger (0682)
but they have to answer to corporate ownership (0683)
dumbwaiters (0684)
lucius set them up to shuttle in the booze (0685)
which had been thrown through the window of the newsroom layout office (0686)
and so we gladly admit that (0687)
we have committed this attack upon the blasphemous (0688)
who published this cartoon (0689)
to defend the honor of all muslims and of allah is beloved prophet (0690)
peace be upon him (0691)
yes i have seen this (0692)
how does it hurt us (0693)
the plaintiff says it is no secret this group has been active in chicago (0694)
6 months earlier (0695)
they committed an identical bombing at a synagogue (0696)
and you had to know that cartoon might provoke them (0697)
my job is to provoke (0698)
because it sells papers (0699)
because freedom of the press is meaningless (0700)
unless somebody actually uses it (0701)
i am not trying to be insensitive (0702)
jeff sanborn was a very good friend (0703)
no culprits were ever apprehended (0704)
we came up together (0705)
the problem mister clay is their argument is (0706)
you did it to increase circulation (0707)
it is not like i commissioned this cartoon (0708)
hoping it was going to anger muslims (0709)
we had an online contest (0710)
best political cartoon any subject (0711)
and you picked the cartoon (0712)
and the federal government continues to investigate (0713)
in consultation with my editors (0714)
jeffrey sanborn too (0715)
sure of course (0716)
so even if stern can show he intended this to happen (0717)
sanborn was contributorily negligent (0718)
might not be a total win (0719)
but it is enough to get us back to the table (0720)
we will need something more than mister clay is testimony to establish it (0721)
what about the cartoonist (0722)
it was an anonymous submission (0723)
i sent the money to a paypal account (0724)
routed through a proxy (0725)
there is no way to trace it (0726)
we will see i will get kalinda on it (0727)
the explosion killed the plaintiff (0728)
returning to the scene of the crime (0729)
you are not going to pout are you (0730)
i hate when men pout (0731)
mister jeffrey sanborn 42 (0732)
go away (0733)
okay let us inspect the level of coincidence here (0734)
i have not seen you since college (0735)
you are confined to the apartment 24 hours a day (0736)
we bump into each other here (0737)
you ask me what i am doing (0738)
i talk about the muhammad cartoon case (0739)
and then the next day lo and behold (0740)
you and your firm are suing my client (0741)
cary think about it (0742)
if i let slip a piece of information like that to you (0743)
managing editor of the cook county vindicator (0744)
you would be on the phone to your boss before our 2nd drink (0745)
okay (0746)
then your turn (0747)
what is going on at work (0748)
okay i will play (0749)
stern wants you (0750)
stern wants me (0751)
last night you wanted me now he wants me (0752)
lockhart gardner is going under (0753)
it is a hollowed out shell (0754)
because stern keeps taking our clients (0755)
in one year (0756)
your firm will be nothing but an empty floor in an office building (0757)
exception (0758)
stern has got equity plenty of business (0759)
and one more thing no contest (0760)
that is right your little contest with missus florrick (0761)
resulted in his death (0762)
you are losing (0763)
i got more billable hours (0764)
and florrick has got a name (0765)
stern is new (0766)
there is a better path to partnership (0767)
think about it (0768)
you will not be alone (0769)
0 i will not be alone (0770)
in leaving lockhart gardner (0771)
you are raiding us (0772)
noted and accepted (0773)
so where are we on getting me to church (0774)
i am filing a religious exception to electronic monitoring (0775)
it does not always work but we will hope for the best (0776)
maybe next sunday (0777)
and i am getting a photographer at the church (0778)
i do not care what the good pastor has to say (0779)
eli we are not doing that (0780)
what is it what is the mater (0781)
well it is probably nothing (0782)
childs is changing the direction with the retrial (0783)
he is giving up the sex angle (0784)
that is all he has got (0785)
is he changing the trial date no 2 months away (0786)
replacing killed (0787)
i do not understand then (0788)
i am hearing chatter about a surprise witness (0789)
so who can hurt you (0790)
well if they are going to lie (0791)
anybody can hurt me (0792)
maybe childs is trying to quietly make this disappear (0793)
i doubt it (0794)
hey honorable (0795)
gerald kozko was at my office today (0796)
he wanted me to tell you something (0797)
he said tell peter i am sorry (0798)
mister sanborn is married (0799)
damn (0800)
no kozko and childs hate each other (0801)
there is no way he is going to grant him immunity (0802)
well he would if it is the only way to get peter (0803)
we need . (0804)
and has 2 teenaged dependents who will suffer (0805)
you are standing in my kitchen (0806)
whatever you have to say you can say it in front of me (0807)
you heard her (0808)
from loss of wages and affection (0809)
missus sanborn (0810)
did your husband have a close relationship with his employer (0811)
mister clay (0812)
yes until recently (0813)
it had become strained their friendship (0814)
mister clay and the cook county vindicator (0815)
and why was that (0816)
objection beyond the scope (0817)
well i really think we are safe here (0818)
do not you (0819)
you may answer missus sanborn (0820)
the paper was in financial trouble (0821)
it must not cross this line (0822)
they had to lay off a lot of staff (0823)
the stress took its toll (0824)
jeff was also frustrated by mister clay is pursuit (0825)
of a new yorker cover (0826)
something controversial (0827)
jointly and severally agree to pay julius (0828)
like the obama fist bump cartoon on the new yorker (0829)
something that would increase readership (0830)
well missus sanborn did your husband help (0831)
mister clay choose the cartoon for publication in the paper (0832)
yes (0833)
it was a contest and he helped mister clay judge it (0834)
but the cartoon that appeared was different was not it (0835)
yes (0836)
i saw the original (0837)
it did not depict muhammad (0838)
it was just a middle eastern man (0839)
jeffrey told me (0840)
that the decision to change it to muhammad was mister clay is (0841)
to generate more controversy (0842)
$250000 from capped business insurance (0843)
is it just me (0844)
or do we really need to find that cartoonist (0845)
so here is your cartoon (0846)
now you see this cross hatching (0847)
how it almost looks like bars (0848)
that can indicate a sense of suffocation (0849)
like they can not say what they mean (0850)
in this case it might indicate (0851)
someone who is a muslim themselves (0852)
fascinating yeah (0853)
does this really work (0854)
graphology (0855)
applied to drawing (0856)
it does if you know what you are looking for (0857)
you do not respect my job do you (0858)
i am incredulous (0859)
it is best with comparison (0860)
you run an image search cross referenced (0861)
with the unique elements of the sample drawing (0862)
still too much (0863)
narrow it by location (0864)
chicago (0865)
and $100000 from capped renter is insurance (0866)
better (0867)
looks like i am a believer (0868)
the thing is when you hired me (0869)
i was told the firm had a program (0870)
for lending associates money against our salaries (0871)
for down payments cars (0872)
accounting turned you down yeah (0873)
and i got my eye on a condo in lincoln park (0874)
interest rates are still low (0875)
look money is a little tight these days that is all (0876)
yeah i just want to know (0877)
if there is anything i should be aware of (0878)
about my future about your . (0879)
no (0880)
but only if we agree now (0881)
nobody is trying to tell you anything (0882)
it is just money is tight (0883)
so i am still in the running (0884)
you are (0885)
nobody is made any decisions yet (0886)
is that it (0887)
yes (0888)
so how is peter doing (0889)
he is good i mean he would be a lot better (0890)
if he had a clearer sense of what childs was planning (0891)
so he got the message (0892)
we agree (0893)
my apology yeah (0894)
look you and peter go back a long way (0895)
if childs is threatening you (0896)
peter wants to help his friends in any way he can (0897)
well i do not want to hurt peter (0898)
missus sanborn (0899)
but it is not just me (0900)
i have a legacy to protect (0901)
my son (0902)
peter has a family too (0903)
we all have families (0904)
okay let us cut the pleasantries (0905)
whatever you have (0906)
or think you can devise to hurt peter (0907)
he has twice as much to hurt you (0908)
i know your reputation mister gold (0909)
then you know i do not screw around (0910)
i know peter has religion (0911)
meaning (0912)
he is off his game (0913)
missus sanborn (0914)
you have a pastor giving him spiritual instruction (0915)
now he is going to church (0916)
hey i am in risk assessment mister gold (0917)
at the moment childs is the bigger risk (0918)
did he give you immunity (0919)
0 that is not good (0920)
not at all (0921)
we do not threaten with a subpoena (0922)
unless he refuses to testify (0923)
the man you are discussing (0924)
how about we do not threaten at all (0925)
yes missus bassir (0926)
where would they put her the mom (0927)
broadview mchenry detention (0928)
general population at cook county (0929)
they make it a shell game (0930)
but you could find her (0931)
then you will receive a telephone call from our monitoring center (0932)
so you are the pushover i am the one who actually does the work (0933)
no no it is fine i can do it (0934)
thank you (0935)
yeah i am trying to be spontaneous these days (0936)
mama (0937)
thanks (0938)
hey my good deed for the year (0939)
thank you missus florrick (0940)

the honorable judge gordon tomlin presiding (0943)
i am judge tomlin (0944)
okay i will see you then (0945)
presiding immigration judge via closed circuit in miami (0946)
currently presiding over cook county i c e (0947)
are we ready miss . (0948)
bow yes your honor (0949)
i c e is petitioning the court (0950)
for summary judgment on simran verma is immediate removal (0951)
and deportation to her native india (0952)
your honor i am sorry (0953)
but simran has lived in america for 27 years (0954)
too loud for the microphone madam (0955)
missus verma has demonstrated good moral character (0956)
okay (0957)
she supports herself as a building manager (0958)
and she would be subjected to undue hardship (0959)
if she were separated from her american born children (0960)
she more than qualifies for an adjusted residence status (0961)
your honor i have a copy (0962)
okay (0963)
of simran is application for a driver is license from the dmv (0964)
on the application she checked the voter registration box (0965)
thus making a false claim of citizenship a federal offense (0966)
your honor these forms are confusing and often filled out by rote (0967)
the application clearly states (0968)
that making a false claim is a serious federal offense (0969)
missus verma should be permanently inadmissible (0970)
as a citizen of the united states (0971)
your honor her ties to america are very strong (0972)
too close for the microphone again madam (0973)
summary judgment approved (0974)
missus verma is deportation is approved (0975)
next case (0976)
0 your honor but your . (0977)
what (0978)
what is happening is that it (0979)
are they taking her back missus florrick (0980)
what happened wait wait mom (0981)
what has happened you can not take her (0982)
mom mom (0983)
this is absurd i am not a criminal (0984)
mister belkin (0985)
so that is what this is about (0986)
i will not confirm or deny (0987)
but madam it would have been better if you would let us question him (0988)
what do you want (0989)
identity theft is a multi $1000000000 burr in the side of america (0990)
all i ask is that amal do his patriotic duty (0991)
help us bring down the major player (0992)
he does that you stop his mother is deportation (0993)
i will put in a good word (0994)
that is the problem with good deeds (0995)

27 years of being illegal (1050)
i would have thought you would have been more sympathetic (1051)

judge asks you a question you answer (1137)
you do not come back with another question (1138)

so you are deciding against me because i am not humble (1141)
no i am deciding against you because you are wrong on the law (1142)
but life is not the classroom (1143)

which attorneys they like they trust (1145)
0 so you do not like me (1146)

what is wrong (1619)
we are not going toward your floor (1620)
what we have here is a rather large (1621)
collection of items with your name on them (1622)
you do not need to be nervous (1623)
i am your friend here (1624)
they are not mine (1625)
really (1626)
look the sheriff ran your i d last night amal (1627)
it triggered a red flag warning to me (1628)
you see there are a dozen credit cards (1629)
driver is licenses passports with your name on em (1630)
you know how that could have happened (1631)
no i do not (1632)
were you paid to let someone use your identity (1633)
simran are you certain (1634)
is everything okay (1635)
yes alicia they just . (1636)
they have a few questions for amal (1637)
it is about work (1638)
dad (1639)
do you do you want me to do anything (1640)
0 no (1641)
i do not know (1642)
they said it would only take a minute and so . (1643)
amal is not in trouble (1644)
you do not want to get in trouble amal (1645)
no then why are not you answering honestly (1646)
i am answering honestly (1647)
i do not know anything about this (1648)
i swear (1649)
excuse me gentlemen (1650)
is amal a suspect here (1651)
because if so you probably should read him his rights (1652)
not a suspect at this time (1653)
we are asking a few questions that is all (1654)
missus florrick is not it (1655)
y yes (1656)
you just accused him of being dishonest (1657)
and warned him he could get into trouble (1658)
we are trying to ascertain his connection (1659)
to an identity theft ring (1660)
simran (1661)
i think you should invite these gentlemen to leave (1662)
we only need a few more minutes missus verma (1663)
if you do not want them here you can ask them to leave simran (1664)
gentlemen . (1665)
would you please leave (1666)
my guess is they are just fishing (1667)
if you accidentally cross the line . (1668)
look i i did not do anything wrong mom (1669)
i swear (1670)
i have to rush to work (1671)

my 1st husband (1687)
it is not half bad (1688)
i wonder if i can get it fitted (1689)
objection your honor (1690)
calls for speculation (1691)
the question asks mister hunter to guess the answer (1692)
rather than rely on facts (1693)
yes that is the definition of speculation (1694)
congratulations mister bigelow (1695)
too bad i did not do that (1696)
sustained (1697)
exception (1698)
noted and when you go to mock trial appeal court (1699)
ms cabrini you can argue it there (1700)
now mister hunter (1701)
i just want to understand the sequence of events (1702)
you say that you saw my clients entering the cottage (1703)
yes i was hunting in the forest when i heard a scream (1704)
actually you said screams (1705)
yes screams (1706)
and you said that you recognize those as belonging to the witch (1707)
that is right she lives in that gingerbread house (1708)
0 so you just assumed (1709)

mom was going to the grocery store (1754)
when this van . (1755)
these men got out and took her (1756)
all we got was this phone number to call (1757)
the line has been busy all day (1758)
i thought your . (1759)
your mom is a citizen right (1760)
she spent $8000 on an immigration attorney who ripped her off (1761)
and never filed for a green card (1762)
so she just gave up (1763)
she is lived here for 27 years (1764)
look i have some names of immigration attorneys (1765)
i will get them for you (1766)
thank you thanks (1767)
if that is all right (1768)
this way (1769)
you are such a pushover (1770)
i am not (1771)
i am responsible (1772)
no i mean i am responsible for the feds questioning him (1773)
you are not responsible for everything bad in the world alicia (1774)
it is all right you sure (1775)
and you shut it down (1776)
he did too (1777)
okay (1778)
you have 3 problems (1779)
cary is a good finisher (1780)
he got a head start (1781)
and will is going to work overtime to appear objective (1782)
unfairly objective (1783)
i am . (1784)
i am just so tired of this (1785)
i know but that is what people like cary count on (1786)
lou . (1787)
talk to diane (1788)
she wants to mentor so ask her to mentor (1789)
it is a bad time to be a lawyer out there (1790)
jocelyn . (1791)
there is no jobs (1792)
i know (1793)
thank you kalinda really (1794)
thank you (1795)
so how did that max wilder info work out for you (1796)
derek (1797)
well (1798)
so what are you doing here detective (1799)
i am buying you a drink (1800)
i was 300 miles away (1801)
at baldy lake fishing (1802)
it was my day off (1803)
and for some reason just out of the blue (1804)
i had this image of you (1805)
do not ask me why (1806)
and lenny (1807)
so i got in my car and i drove back here (1808)
i am divorced (1809)
i have a kid owen (1810)
he is 6 (1811)
am i boring you (1812)
yeah (1813)
accounts lenny or litigation (1814)
litigation (1815)
what am i doing wrong (1816)
is that your car (1817)
yeah (1818)
get in it (1819)
why (1820)
now what (1821)
300 miles (1822)
7 hours (1823)
that is 2 of yours and 2 of mine (1824)
we would respectfully submit your honor (1825)
that in view of the timing of mister wilder is accident and (1826)
the suspicious removal of the signed last page of our divorce agreement (1827)
and the junior associates (1828)
clearly max wilder is intention was to be free of his ex wife (1829)
objection (1830)
withdrawn free of the respondent (1831)
your honor (1832)
this is very simple (1833)
we are not even going to get into shaina is motives in wanting to unplug max (1834)
objection (1835)
like i said it is not pertinent (1836)
neither is the fact that she got him to change his will (1837)
and leave her everything (1838)
objection (1839)
you gentleman (1840)
see that there is no jury here right (1841)
my apologies your honor (1842)
in legal terms wife trumps mistress (1843)
we have to decide now (1844)
your honor we would like to introduce a new piece of evidence (1845)
i am sorry she is on the other line (1846)
your honor (1847)
this is max wilder junior (1848)
5 months old (1849)
and these are the results of his paternity test (1850)
shaina and max have kept this child out of the public eye (1851)
for obvious reasons (1852)
okay (1853)
let me see if i can sum this up (1854)
cary or alicia (1855)
i have got the fiancee over here (1856)
who also happens to be the mother of mister wilder is sole offspring (1857)
your honor we would question this paternity . (1858)
and she wants guardianship (1859)
so that she can withdraw life support from mister wilder (1860)
in which case she inherits his entire fortune (1861)
then over here i have the wife (1862)
she wants to maintain mister wilder is life support (1863)
in which case she is free to spend his entire fortune (1864)
i do not think (1865)
it is fair to characterize your honor we would argue that . (1866)
yes yes yes (1867)
everybody has mister wilder is best interest at heart i am sure (1868)
so here is what we are going to do (1869)
friday we will decide friday (1870)
the court is taking temporary guardianship of mister wilder (1871)
and we will hear evidence on his wishes regarding end of life decisions (1872)
please prepare briefs and testimony (1873)
we will hear on it this afternoon (1874)
let us get into max is house (1875)
dig up anything you can (1876)
e mails songs poems (1877)
anything that points to him valuing life (1878)
good (1879)
alicia . (1880)
where is kalinda (1881)
she was supposed to be here (1882)
phone her (1883)
and let us keep it to ourselves okay (1884)
let us get her over to max is house (1885)
i will try her again (1886)
i mean if he had a living will i would have known (1887)
said he wanted to be frozen and we could wake him up (1888)
when the technology was available (1889)
good good (1890)
stories like that does not sound like someone (1891)
who wants the doctor to pull the plug (1892)
i mean who knows you know (1893)
i do not want to deal with a lot of last minute maneuvering on this (1894)
like like most creative geniuses (1895)
his deepest convictions changed hourly (1896)
is there any chance he could have downloaded a living will (1897)
from someplace like legalzoom no no (1898)
it never would have occurred to him outside of a lawyer is office (1899)
can i get your cell number (1900)
in case i need to prep you for testimony (1901)
yeah no problem (1902)
hey where you been (1903)

i am really proud of the work i have done here (1933)
as you should be (1934)
and i wanted to make sure that you saw that (1935)
look alicia i do not know what you are hearing (1936)
but that is all we will be looking at (1937)
okay good (1938)
you have my word (1939)
when we decide nothing else will enter the picture (1940)
other than your work (1941)
diane can i grab a minute (1942)
yeah yeah sorry mister danforth (1943)
we are trying to collect on all accounts (1944)

my god he was so charming (1949)
missus wilder (1950)

yeah (1959)
the way you look at me crooked smile (1960)
i am sorry (1961)
he is drunk (1962)
no they did a tox screen for alcohol and drugs after the accident (1963)
he was sober (1964)
that is not sober (1965)
he is so drunk he can not even answer his phone (1966)
mister gold in my office (1967)
so you are talking to her (1968)
i am (1969)
play the mentor card (1970)
one of the reasons we did not want this to be public knowledge (1971)
is because we did not want a lot of last minute politicking (1972)
again (1973)
i understand i just . (1974)
could you hint to me where i stand (1975)
i like you alicia (1976)
i did not start out by liking you (1977)
and of course you know will likes you (1978)
you have more than proved yourself (1979)
sorry alicia i was upstairs (1980)
but . (1981)
we have never seen an economic climate like this (1982)
i 2nd chaired on a lot of winners (1983)
yes and so has cary (1984)
he is had higher billable hours (1985)
and his receivables are coming in high and immediate (1986)
so i i do not understand have i lost (1987)
and david lee needs to see you in 10 minutes (1988)
it is not subjective (1989)
it is who keeps the doors open (1990)
cary does not have a family (1991)
he is in here every night at 9 0 (1992)
every morning at 8 0 (1993)
then i will work harder (1994)
and so will cary (1995)
i do not know what to do (1996)
i have worked hard (1997)
you say that is not enough so i will work harder (1998)
what is chrissy doing (1999)
you tell me cary can work harder still (2000)
so what do you want (2001)
tell me what you want because i can not lose this job (2002)

 it was wrong for me to come here (2067)
i do not want to do this (2068)
i am not this person (2069)
cary do you have a minute (2070)
missus florrick if i know one thing in life (2071)
it is that everybody is that person (2072)
let me make a few calls okay (2073)
friday (2074)
hey i am just making the calls (2075)
sure what is up (2076)
you get the client it is your client (2077)
okay (2078)
when they put in the sign they left a hole in the wall (2079)
thank you (2080)
hey we are like family right (2081)
i just heard something upstairs (2082)
i guess i can not let go (2083)
when max and i were in rehab . (2084)
 there was this 12 step quote we used to say (2085)
do not quit before the miracle happens (2086)
and they say that it is a 1000000 to one shot (2087)
but max is life (2088)
becoming who he was . (2089)
that was a 1000000 to one shot (2090)
max loved life (2091)
he loved action (2092)
he was going to skydive on his 80th birthday (2093)
so i know for a fact that he would never want this (2094)
i am sorry (2095)
there is a good chance that the state is attorney will not prosecute peter (2096)
but he has gone (2097)
caroline . (2098)
i know we both love him (2099)
but he is . (2100)
this is torturing him (2101)
is that the tox report (2102)
yep (2103)
you are not going to let me see it are you (2104)
i am thinking about it (2105)
i had him checked for drugs and alcohol (2106)
but they already . (2107)
when they did not find anything (2108)
i had them check for other foreign substances (2109)
mister wilder ingested ethylene glycol (2110)
antifreeze (2111)
because of kozko is suicide (2112)
that is why the drunken appearance (2113)
we are opening up a murder investigation (2114)
with your client as the prime suspect (2115)
why (2116)
a $40000000 motive for one thing (2117)
great (2118)
where is the rest (2119)
why are not you answering my calls (2120)
because i am in a relationship (2121)
i do not believe you believe me (2122)
not with that kiss (2123)
look i know you have vulnerability issues (2124)
actually yes (2125)
i do not want to cuddle with you (2126)
i just . (2127)
that is all (2128)
purely recreational (2129)
and if that does happen (2130)
you go to somebody else for emotional validation (2131)
he is coming in today that is what i heard (2132)
drink your drink pay the bill (2133)
then follow me out (2134)
you and i will have to get on the same page quickly (2135)
what page is that (2136)
toxicology report pinpoints (2137)
the poisoning as happening between 10 0 a m and noon (2138)
when max was at the house (2139)
but i was not at max is house (2140)
do you have any proof (2141)
that was just before you went to court (2142)
i do not know i mean i i guess so (2143)
i am trying to think (2144)
the police believe they have established motive caroline (2145)
the campaign (2146)
if you stand just right (2147)
now they are trying to establish access by putting you at the house (2148)
could shaina have been there (2149)
yeah i mean she has a key so i guess it is possible (2150)
do you really think that they suspect me (2151)
yeah (2152)
who is that (2153)
it is our savior (2154)
so mister jordan . (2155)
vernon please (2156)
so vernon you have been looking us over i hear (2157)
i will not do interviews and i will not do photos (2158)
that is right i love chicago (2159)
summers of 57 58 i drove the city bus (2160)
really (2161)
best buses in the world (2162)
my 1st big city experience (2163)
well i do not think we would be speaking out of turn (2164)
to say we are happy to be looked over (2165)
i know and i respect that my children will not either (2166)
we are hoping you can open some doors for us to washington (2167)
well it is a new economy (2168)
we all have to diversify (2169)
so after your tire kicking what do you think vernon (2170)
i think the firm lacks focus (2171)
it seems as if you are taking cases on a whim (2172)
i think you have nailed our vulnerability (2173)
more passion sometimes than sense (2174)
will and i know that we need a referee (2175)
so we would be willing to offer a 3 way split (2176)
ii am sorry i thought . (2177)
i want to buy you out (2178)
if i could be so bold . (2179)
is that not what you want (2180)
no you can not (2181)
well that did not go well (2182)
who would have thought our firm means more without us than with us (2183)
really undercuts one is confidence (2184)
right got it (2185)
it is time to make some tough decisions (2186)
you can hear everything going on in the conference room (2187)
and you were not here (2188)
no (2189)
you never went to his house (2190)
anyway that is not why i am here (2191)
that day no (2192)
who has keys to his house (2193)
well i am not completely sure (2194)
jay (2195)
as far as i remember (2196)
max shaina and the housekeeper (2197)
and missus wilder too (2198)
well yes (2199)
when was the last time you saw max (2200)
the night before (2201)

and he seemed in a good mood you know (2203)
looking forward to his wedding (2204)
can i have his business card (2205)
whose his (2206)
the housekeeper what are her hours (2207)
i do not know (2208)

0 sorry sorry (2212)
hello (2213)
so we are all set (2214)
my client receives a 1000000 a year for life (2215)
my client gets the rest of the estate and full guardianship (2216)
of a comatose patient (2217)
it is what she wants (2218)
so you are the reason jay did it (2219)
well i am not the reason (2220)
i know i tried to convince him otherwise (2221)
but max and shaina were planning to change the will after they got married (2222)
shaina wanted to remove jay (2223)

it is insulting$140000 a year (2371)

i think they are deciding on junior associates this week (2388)
i mean the thing is i like alicia (2389)
i think she is doing really well iven all her problems at home you know (2390)
it is not really ageism to ask how many more (2391)
good working years does anyone have left (2392)
that just makes good sense (2393)
yes and you always had such admiration for family law (2394)
0 sorry your honor (2395)
it is an important call (2396)
my client . (2397)
then let me answer it for you (2398)
anybody else (2399)

missus wilder has acquiesced to a divorce (2403)
we have a signed divorce agreement (2404)
and mister wilderwhere is he (2405)
i am sorry your honor (2406)
my guess is that was in fact mister wilder calling (2407)
0 then it is unfortunate you did not answer it before court counselor (2408)
if i could ask for a 30 minute recess your honor (2409)
to ascertain mister wilder is whereabouts (2410)
face it (2411)
we have no problem with that your honor (2412)
mister kreutzer in my courtroom the people is time (2413)

what happened (2418)
max wilder was just in a motorcycle accident (2419)
is is he all right (2420)
no he is in a coma (2421)
can you believe it (2422)
only difference is mine makes money (2423)
kreutzer is going to have a fit (2424)
yes margie shh shh shh just listen (2425)
you made notes on the wilder prenup (2426)
what does it say on power of attorney (2427)
she could get half (2428)
yep if he stays in a coma $40000000 estate (2429)
margie you are killing me (2430)
we need to tell her (2431)
no no no we need to make her filthy rich 1st (2432)

it is a bad economy david that is all (2434)
margie now (2435)
we are good we are good (2436)
what did you do your honor (2437)
we already have a divorce agreement (2438)
we are righting the ship (2439)

第一季 第二十一集 (2451)
根据yyets字幕校订 (2452)
i have no love for this place (2453)
you do not understand (2454)
this just turned into a $40000000 divorce (2455)
no it is just me and alicia (2456)
i need troops (2457)
on their way and i will take litigation (2458)
but i do not want to jump to harper greene unless i have to (2459)
max wilder was just in a motorcycle accident (2460)
he is in a coma (2461)
you are kidding no (2462)
and our client controls his $40000000 estate (2463)
if he stays in a coma (2464)
here is the rub (2465)
david is looking at the will (2466)
our guess is he wrote our client out (2467)
so if he dies she gets nothing (2468)
just the prenup (2469)
so we are cheering for him to stay in a coma (2470)
effectively (2471)
we are like ghouls (2472)
as long as we are solvent ghouls (2473)
i do not like boxes (2474)
0 what do you think of vernon jordan (2475)
what do i think of vernon jordan yes (2476)
as a 3rd partner (2477)
0 i is that a possibility (2478)
we are bringing in a 3rd partner (2479)
he has been sniffing around us (2480)
looking for an opening into chicago (2481)
well that would be a lifesaver (2482)
we would not have to make cuts (2483)
i will try to set up a meeting (2484)
i will take any support i can get cary (2485)
margie said he is coming in for a divorce settlement (2486)
i need you on the wilder divorce (2487)
it suddenly became important (2488)
yeah yeah sure sure anything (2489)
i will head off right away (2490)
yes i have heard about this messiah partner (2491)
i did not say anything (2492)
0 my god (2493)
they say he just swerved into oncoming traffic (2494)
for 2 months now can not wait (2495)
i always hated that thing (2496)
alicia this is jay van zandt hi (2497)
max is manager (2498)
alicia is my lawyer (2499)
i do not know (2500)
maybe i should not be here (2501)
he talked about you caroline just last week (2502)
you could help us (2503)
no he did not (2504)
do not try to make me feel better (2505)
he looks so s . (2506)
3400000 in kauai (2507)
collect on overdue accounts (2508)
5500000 of the properties in chicago (2509)
you can not use your cell phone in here (2510)
you know that is a myth right (2511)
where is the doctor he is in with missus wilder (2512)
missus . (2513)
the helmet protected the frontal and temporal bone (2514)
but the base of the helmet snapped back (2515)
causing severe trauma to the cerebellum (2516)
we have stopped the bleeding but . (2517)
yes that is our problem (2518)
i am sorry (2519)
it is a subdural hematoma (2520)
which means . (2521)
missus wilder your husband is effectively brain dead (2522)
i am sorry (2523)
but not dead dead (2524)
he excuse me who . (2525)
i am his wife you divorced him (2526)
she did not (2527)
doctor are you saying that mister wilder can never be revived (2528)
effectively yes (2529)
doctor i look at contracts all day long (2530)
i start making collection calls to my divorcees (2531)
and when i see the word effectively (2532)
i know it means no (2533)
medicine sir is not a contract (2534)
with this massive loss of brain tissue there is (2535)
a one in a 1000000 likelihood he would revive (2536)
but a 1000000 to one means life (2537)
and life needs to be cherished and treasured (2538)
what other value do we hold higher (2539)
sir the only thing that is keeping mister wilder alive is a machine (2540)
in essence he is already dead (2541)
doctor (2542)
do you have another assessment (2543)
no (2544)
they would bolt to another firm before i can hang up (2545)
i had a patient (2546)
he fell off a ladder in 1988 (2547)
and he ended up in a persistent vegetative state (2548)
i made the same speech that i just heard in there (2549)
and then 21 years later he just woke up (2550)
i do not know any other way to say it (2551)
he woke up from a 21 year sleep (2552)
he was a one in a 1000000 shot (2553)
and yes science and medicine deal in repeatable phenomena and not this (2554)
give us till the end of the week (2555)
but i do not make that speech anymore (2556)
shaina has filed a petition for legal guardianship (2557)
so she can unplug max (2558)
she can file all she wants (2559)
wife trumps girlfriend (2560)
my guess is kreutzer argues intent (2561)
both max wilder and caroline initialed all (2562)
but the last missing page of a divorce settlement (2563)
good job by the way alicia (2564)
that is what i like to hear (2565)
when are we in court again (2566)
tomorrow (2567)
should we be talking about negotiating with shaina (2568)
caroline could live with half the estate are you kidding (2569)
this is a gold digger who wants to steal from our client (2570)
i say we go in whole hog we protect our client (2571)
and protect our future relationship with her (2572)
we need to talk (2573)
you have until friday (2574)
i have . (2575)
no i have 2 weeks (2576)
diane and will are deciding between you and cary on friday (2577)
where did you hear that (2578)
i thought he was dead agos florrick (2579)
cary was going door to door with equity partners (2580)
lining up support (2581)
he heard it from your assistant (2582)
my guess is he is phoning in on accounts loading up on receivables (2583)
how are you with will (2584)
i do not know (2585)
what happened (2586)
we will cull the herd (2587)
i do not know (2588)
you do know you just do not want to say (2589)
did you sleep with him (2590)
no (2591)
so that is the problem you did not sleep with him (2592)
no we talked (2593)
we had a moment (2594)
i am phoning to check everybody is temperature (2595)
the ceo was just accused of murder (2596)
everybody will scramble (2597)
not necessarily the buyer is motivated and money is money (2598)
what is that about (2599)
0 the layoffs (2600)
yes will not be a fun day (2601)
and we are not out of the woods yet we have a lot of trimming to do (2602)
do you have your keys (2603)
cary . (2604)
i am just getting my laptop (2605)
i just wanted to say i am sorry (2606)
sorry you got the job (2607)
my . (2608)
or sorry for what you did to get the job (2609)
sorry we both did not get the job (2610)
alicia here is the thing . (2611)
you like to think you are a good person (2612)
your car keys (2613)
and maybe at one time you were (2614)
but we both know (2615)
you will do whatever it takes (2616)
sleeping with the boss check (2617)
cary if it makes you feel better to think that (2618)
do you have them (2619)
then think it but i do not have a name (2620)
alicia i do not have a fairy godmother i can phone up (2621)
or the whole chicago political machine (2622)
i had to work i had to sweat (2623)
i had to make money for this firm (2624)
and that is just not enough (2625)
sir you have to leave (2626)
i need my laptop and my personal items (2627)
you can itemize them and they will be collected (2628)
and sent to your home (2629)
why (2630)
i need them now (2631)
that is not possible sir (2632)
they will be returned to you within 3 working days (2633)
i just want to compare them (2634)
this was not fair (2635)
and i was stupidi acted like it would be (2636)
so these letters were sent to sweeney (2637)
yeah sweeney is at least telling the truth about being stalked (2638)
you are dead meat my darling (2639)
i feast on dead meat (2640)
is she still a jane doe yep (2641)
what (2642)
you know what is odd (2643)
these letters are filled with details from his trial (2644)
a juror (2645)
it is the legal language she uses (2646)
i want to kill that idiot deponent (2647)
i hate the rule 30 slut (2648)
are you trying to distract me (2649)
it is like someone in the business (2650)
these are from the 1st trial (2651)
who is this (2652)
court reporter (2653)
yeah (2654)
yeah (2655)
that could be her (2656)
yeah (2657)
what is her name (2658)
kalinda (2659)
what are you doing (2660)
burton get ready to write down an address (2661)
you won he lost (2662)
not to sound too melodramatic your honor (2663)
but objection really (2664)
your honor missus kozko heard directly from her husband (2665)
that if he were to die under mysterious circumstances (2666)
that it would be at peter florrick is hand (2667)
yes and i heard from a butterfly it would not be (2668)
both are hearsay statements (2669)
so you are going to turn this into some morbid thing (2670)
your honor and equally inadmissible (2671)
the peterson law allows for exactly such hearsay testimony (2672)
so let me get this straight (2673)
it allows for hearsay as long as a murder is established (2674)
and a murder is established here (2675)
because there is a hearsay statement that establishes it (2676)
i mean tell me when the snake actually devours its tail okay (2677)
ms tascioni you are ridiculing established illinois law (2678)
because that is who you are (2679)
yes your honor gleefully (2680)
well i know i am the youngest judge on the bench (2681)
but yes your honor we are all in awe (2682)
but i will overrule your objection (2683)
given the peterson law this testimony is allowed (2684)
so let us go (2685)
if you have a problem with that (2686)
you can take it up with the supreme court (2687)
okay now i get to work (2688)
hybristophiliac (2689)
women who are irresistibly attracted to dangerous men (2690)
it is quite common (2691)
so we are all going to have to work harder (2692)
women who propose to charlie manson (2693)
or send their panties to jeffrey dahmer (2694)
45 years (2695)
no (2696)
see you in court (2697)
fine this is not gangbanger number 5 ms lockhart (2698)
this is colin sweeney (2699)
people want him behind bars (2700)
then people should find better evidence (2701)
because this screams self defense madam (2702)
the thing is . (2703)
these letters did not just go one way (2704)
how is peter doing fine thank you (2705)
let me get my bag (2706)
where would you get these (2707)
the victim is house (2708)
you see mister sweeney wrote back encouraging her taunting her (2709)
i am sure you can find a psychological term for that too (2710)
hysterical prosecution (2711)
45 years (2712)
here is a copy of the victim is diary (2713)
with some very interesting entries on your client (2714)
and some quite specific descriptions of their sexual practices (2715)
it is a lockhart gardner tradition (2716)
so this is you this is me (2717)
milking it (2718)
now you are an associate (2719)
the wife of peter florrick representing a killer (2720)
interesting i had not considered that (2721)
well what about this (2722)
the state is attorney hired a sick killer obsessed court reporter (2723)
for some of the state is most high profile criminal cases (2724)
now that will be a fun lawsuit (2725)
well you got me there missus florrick (2726)
2 shots of tequila (2727)
so let us try this why do not we both just do our jobs (2728)
do more with less (2729)
of course i wrote back (2730)
i love a good fetish (2731)
cut the crap mister sweeney (2732)
you are looking at 45 years (2733)
you are right i am sorry (2734)
please take a look at the diary mister sweeney (2735)
sheila warburg (2736)
my god how prosaic (2737)
sweaty suburban sex with sheila warburg (2738)
we need to figure out what is true and what she made up (2739)
well this is not true this one here (2740)
i am not opposed to it in principle but my goodness (2741)
if you could underline the parts that are fiction (2742)
certainly (2743)
look . (2744)
i had sex with her twice (2745)
she liked to pretend to break in and handcuff me (2746)
we would wrestle then we would have sex (2747)
but this time she would not stop (2748)
i tried to get her to drop the knife but then we we struggled (2749)
and and the knife . (2750)
it went in (2751)
that is it (2752)
okay we will get back to you (2753)
right i have to go give me a few hours (2754)
julius (2755)
the merger is on (2756)
if anything mister sweeney is troubles have shored up the buyer is interest (2757)
they were scared of his volatility (2758)
meaning (2759)
well we are not changing our defense strategy but . (2760)
it would benefit us if mister sweeney took a plea (2761)
okay we can not say that (2762)
but i am backing away from mister sweeney is defense (2763)
a chinese wall (2764)
you and alicia continue and we will say no more (2765)
make any deal you can defend him any way you can (2766)
we will not talk to you you will not talk to us okay (2767)
got it (2768)

alicia i am taking responsibility for your irresponsibility (2796)
were you visiting someone else in the building mister gold (2797)
i was but i thought i would make a little detour (2798)
i can not talk about any ongoing investigations (2799)
0 i did not think you could (2800)
i thought i would talk about em 0 knock yourself out (2801)
glenn childs has it out for my client (2802)
it is a politically motivated prosecution (2803)
and the fbi should not be in the business of taking sides (2804)
you are reading too much into my visit with mister childs (2805)
he is giving you evidence against florrick (2806)
he is suggesting that florrick is responsible for kozko is death (2807)
and you are buying it (2808)
well you know your secret investigation of my client (2809)
let me see your phone (2810)
it is no longer a secret (2811)
i have seen this (2812)

you do not like to hunt for new game (2822)
you would rather take down an already bleeding deer (2823)
because you want to look good for your superiors (2824)
well this is just to say that we are not bleeding (2825)
we have a lot of fight left in us yet (2826)

there was blood on the dog is fur from the victim (2833)

blood when she broke in (2835)
no she did not cut herself from breaking in (2836)
it is from the struggle (2837)

she was not alive after the struggle right (2839)
and there was also blood from sweeney (2840)
and these hesitation knife wounds (2841)

with a tentative angling of the knife (2843)
someone hesitated before they killed the dog yep (2844)

he was so innocent (2847)

prosecuting the worst scum in chicago (2897)
i know who you are cary (2898)
i know you are responsible for some of our worst defeats (2899)
and i also know that you were underappreciated (2900)
and undervalued at lockhart gardner (2901)
i want you to join us i want you to yes (2902)
yeah that is fine thanks (2903)
i will need your help with alicia florrick (2904)
she and her husband yes (2905)

thanks (2908)
you do not look like a man who is going to be free in a few days (2909)
here we go i think i hold control shift and d (2910)
no f (2911)
no actually ms tascioni i i am a little busy (2912)
i have a client (2913)
yes the problem is i lack confidence with computers (2914)
can we do this another time (2915)
did you know missus kozko has 3 children (2916)
anthony lisa and arthur (2917)
i did not (2918)
anthony is the oldest lisa is the middle child and . (2919)
darn (2920)
control c (2921)
arthur is the youngest (2922)
yes arthur is the youngest (2923)
well mister and missus kozko (2924)
placed $45000 in all of their accounts for college (2925)
there has been a hitch (2926)
mister gold (2927)
very nice gesture (2928)
and this money was not to be touched (2929)
until they graduated from high school (2930)
well anthony already graduated from college so he spent his (2931)
and lisa is in college now (2932)
so she is halfway through her spending (2933)
look i really miss daniel golden (2934)
and arthur . (2935)
arthur did not start spending his college money until this year (2936)
2 weeks ago to be specific (2937)
okay (2938)
well the funny thing is arthur is not in college (2939)
in fact arthur was a stillborn birth in 1992 (2940)
well when the obama white house calls you got to go (2941)
now that is funny yes (2942)
and that got me thinking (2943)
who is withdrawing all this money from his bank account (2944)
and where is it withdrawn (2945)
funny you should ask (2946)
stl bank and trust in savannah (2947)
georgia no (2948)
did you know there is another savannah in the cayman islands (2949)
i did not know that (2950)
it is interesting is not it (2951)
so how are you ahead of the police on this (2952)
they are not looking (2953)
golden said she is the better litigator (2954)
you seem to be down one partner today (2955)
and i am wearing a different tie (2956)
what is that matter (2957)
we want involuntary manslaughter 5 years (2958)
with 40 time off (2959)
that is 3 years for a brutal sexual homicide (2960)
2nd degree 15 years and we are putting (2961)
a 24 hour clock on it (2962)
it is just easy to underestimate her (2963)
offer expires tomorrow (2964)
we have proof that sweeney was stalked (2965)
can we at least stipulate the victim stalked him (2966)
agreed he was stalked so (2967)
there are stalker statutes on the books (2968)
statutes that my husband instituted when he was in office (2969)
and your point is missus florrick (2970)
talk to your boss (2971)
what sort of message would he be sending (2972)
to stalking victims if sweeney is prosecuted (2973)
well she must be very very good (2974)
are you really trying a blame the victim defense with colin sweeney (2975)
offer him 10 years and we do not have to go to trial (2976)
then let me talk to my boss (2977)
where is diane (2978)
chinese wall (2979)
because i am greatly underestimating her (2980)
criminal and acquisitions (2981)
the merger (2982)
yes it is my guess (2983)
it is probably more lucrative if sweeney is out of the picture (2984)
if sweeney takes a plea he can be removed as ceo (2985)
does sweeney know about this (2986)
he knows that we represent his criminal and financial interests (2987)
yes (2988)
feighen ladsloe the murderer (2989)
on death row (2990)
sheila corresponded with him (2991)
before sweeney (2992)
you know i thought i recognized those entries in her diary (2993)
the ones sweeney said were fiction (2994)
they were from feighen is trial (2995)
the court reporter (2996)
yeah i am checking all of her trials now (2997)
see what other killers she corresponded with (2998)
where you going (2999)
to tell julius (3000)
this could get them down from 10 years (3001)
ms tascioni hi (3002)
hey hey how is that chinese wall (3003)
eli gold (3004)
missus florrick (3005)
as much i like keeping our working relationship collegial (3006)
do not forget you are a junior associate (3007)
and i am an equity partner (3008)
watch your tone (3009)
yes sir i will (3010)
0 yes hello (3011)
i think we should reconsider the plea bargain (3012)
kalinda is found new evidence (3013)
what evidence sheila warbur she stalked other killers (3014)
so you think he is innocent (3015)
no (3016)
i think he is innocent of this (3017)
you are not good with computers are you (3018)
i am ready to hear missus kozko is testimony ms tascioni (3019)
yes just one last objection your honor (3020)
the peterson lawas atrocious as it may be . (3021)
objection sustained (3022)
it requires that mister florrick not only profit from a murder (3023)
but be the instrument of that murder correct (3024)
are you asking me ms tascioni (3025)
my son keeps buying me new ones (3026)
no but you can answer if you want to (3027)
and you can get to the point (3028)
0 okay well (3029)
for mister kozko to be murdered (3030)
one key thing is required that we overlooked (3031)
and what is that ms tascioni (3032)
that he be dead (3033)
i did it (3034)
and then just backing awayand laughing (3035)
this is an atm photo taken a week ago (3036)
at bcp bank and trust in savannah cayman islands (3037)
your honor missus kozko is hearsay testimony is inadmissible (3038)
and mister kozko is video proffer is likewise inadmissible (3039)
for the very simple reason that mister kozko is still alive (3040)
quiet quiet please (3041)
it is done (3042)
you are free (3043)
kalinda (3044)
so what are we watching evidence (3045)
so your boy is free (3046)
my boy (3047)
florrick he just won (3048)
really yeah (3049)
so i hear there are some tapes (3050)
0 there are always some tapes (3051)
and i hear that they hurt childs and florrick (3052)
so neither wanted to use them (3053)
mutually assured destruction (3054)
sounds like a fairy tale (3055)
for the retrial yep (3056)
funny how fairy tales turn out to be true (3057)
here is the thing kalinda (3058)
this is not about childs or florrick (3059)
this is about childs and florrick (3060)
we are investigating them both (3061)
and i just do not want you to get hurt (3062)
thank you for your concern (3063)
but the prosecution lost its only witness right (3064)
i am your friend here (3065)
it is good to know (3066)
so you would advise me to take this (3067)
it is the best deal we could have made (3068)
8 years (3069)
and this is after we started with (3070)
what i would have said was a an adamant 45 (3071)
missus florrick (3072)
it is true (3073)
they started with 45 years (3074)
kozko committed suicide so they do not have a case (3075)
and why not court (3076)
well it is coming down to perceptions mister sweeney (3077)
we would have filed for a change of venue but . (3078)
i am famous everywhere (3079)
yes (3080)
they like me here in prison (3081)
i am like the king of kings (3082)
and i thought monday would be a simple matter of a dismissal (3083)
it is not unlike getting the best table at schwa actually (3084)
same jockeying for position (3085)
we have until 6 0 to take the plea (3086)
okay thank you julius (3087)
ii i need to talk to missus florrick for a 2nd (3088)
we are working together (3089)
yes i understand (3090)
i just have a piece of gossip i want to share please (3091)
but watch (3092)
it is about the merger yes (3093)
the company means more with me out of the picture yes (3094)
and . (3095)
can i get better than 8 years (3096)
no (3097)
and if we go to trial (3098)
i do not know (3099)
sheila warburg has stalked other killers (3100)
but i do not know if that is enough to overcome your . (3101)
your baggage (3102)
yeah (3103)
yeah that is that is what i thought (3104)
well . (3105)
i did kill my wife (3106)
so i guess the universe is having its little joke at my expense (3107)
you killed her (3108)
your face (3109)
thank you (3110)
thank you for being honest (3111)
prosecution interview b 3 (3112)
you are welcome (3113)
well . (3114)
people v peter florrick (3115)
off i go (3116)
peter was pretty bald about it (3117)
it is over is not it (3118)
looks like it (3119)
zach is drinking champagne (3120)
zach it is soda (3121)
$45000 would buy you a certain amount of access (3122)
do you know all these people (3123)
some (3124)
mike hey (3125)
so what are we going to do (3126)
well clean up (3127)
no after that (3128)
0 i do not know (3129)
what do you want to do (3130)
buy a big house (3131)
go to europe (3132)
he could not have done it without you (3133)
0 that is not true (3134)
it is we women stay in the shadows (3135)
we smile we comfort we nurse (3136)
but we are always there (3137)
$85000 more (3138)
you are a good woman alicia (3139)
alicia (3140)
he needs you (3141)
alicia (3142)
i am not the lawyer (3143)
you need to speak to my wife (3144)
did he say what he needed the money for (3145)
honey this is michael from the afl cio (3146)
and he is looking for a very good chicago based law firm (3147)
alicia works for lockhart gardner (3148)
she is one of their best lawyers (3149)
if i do say so myself (3150)
so why do not you 2 talk (3151)
a down payment on a bigger house (3152)
this is a video proffer completed by mister kozko before his death (3153)
the prosecution now plans to introduce it into evidence (3154)
but they can not because it is hearsay (3155)
that is right (3156)
and they do not want to use it (3157)
they want the press to use it (3158)
well that was my 1st guess (3159)
but these are not the motions of a prosecution winding down (3160)
peter promised me an ear (3161)
and he also promised me his friendship (3162)
come on everybody join the happy couple on the dance floor (3163)
let go no (3164)
you know will feels the same way about you (3165)
no he does not (3166)

hello what is wrong (3281)

here comes the cavalry (3283)
he never hurt anyone (3284)
chilihe barely even barked (3285)
so you are saying she killed your dog (3286)
even though the victim has (3287)
no defensive wounds on her body from a canine attack (3288)
mister sweeney is choosing not to answer at this time detective (3289)
missus florrick (3290)
you said that your fingerprints were on . (3291)
on the doorbell on the entering doorknob (3292)
on the banister . (3293)
on the camera (3294)
he opened the back of the camera (3295)
i can not answer that due to attorney client privilege (3296)
but your fingerprints are on the camera (3297)
yes as i said (3298)
so you are still insisting that you did not tamper with evidence (3299)
yes even though i smell alcohol on your breath (3300)
tony . (3301)
this is my job ms sharma (3302)
i do not interfere with your job (3303)
we were celebrating when i received a phone call from mister sweeney (3304)
excuse me from mister gardner . (3305)
a partner at my firm (3306)
he told me to come here to collect contracts (3307)
i arrived by cab i did not drive myself (3308)
you are under arrest for murder mister sweeney (3309)
back in the cuffs i go (3310)
listen to me mister sweeney (3311)
remain silent (3312)
irony does not work here (3313)
jokes do not work (3314)
do you understand (3315)
you have the right to remain silent (3316)
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law (3317)
all rise (3318)
the honorable graham schickel presiding (3319)
good morning (3320)
as the youngest justice on the bench in the state of illinois (3321)
i would like to say welcome (3322)
and i believe you have a motion mister state is attorney (3323)
i do your honor (3324)
we move to introduce into evidence the video proffer (3325)
made by our key witness gerald kozco recently deceased (3326)
yes your honor hi (3327)
i hate to object right off the bat here (3328)
but the key word here is deceased (3329)
mister florrick has a right to challenge his accuser (3330)
i can not cross examine a dead witness as much as i would like to try (3331)
your honor 2 years ago (3332)
illinois legislature in a 109 to 0 vote (3333)
passed the peterson law which makes us the only state in the union (3334)
which allows hearsay evidencesuch as this profferwhen (3335)
the accused benefits from the death (3336)
ah getting novel on us mister childs (3337)
this law is almost as new as i am (3338)
yes your honor (3339)
but unfortunately for mister childs (3340)
the peterson law requires the accused benefit not just from a death (3341)
but from a murder he committed (3342)
and mister kozco committed suicide (3343)
the police have not made that determination your honor (3344)
no body has been found yet (3345)
and we will present evidence to the contrary (3346)
they fired him (3347)
my apologies your honor (3348)
i am sorry i found that humorous (3349)
mister childs would like to prove my client is a murderer (3350)
so he can prosecute him for corruption (3351)
well that is certainly novel (3352)
well novel or not (3353)
we will hear evidence on this alleged murder tomorrow (3354)
they kept you (3355)
guys in the bureau might want to keep track of mister florrick . (3356)
yes he is talking with the feds (3357)
i got a client last minute through peter (3358)
i think things just got more serious (3359)
coordinating strategy (3360)
i do not know (3361)
hi are you 2 coordinating strategy (3362)
mister childs and i are old friends (3363)
what a relief (3364)
she would ambush me i would fight (3365)
and if i won we would have sex (3366)
she was your stalker but you encouraged her (3367)
it was a game (3368)
she would break in i would disarm her we would have sex (3369)
it was terrific (3370)
this time it was different (3371)
this time she tried to kill me (3372)
the police are calling the victim a jane doe (3373)
do you have any idea who she was (3374)
no i just knew her as sheila penn (3375)
you said she wrote you (3376)
yes classic stalker letters (3377)
where are they (3378)
in his bedside table (3379)
which means the police already have it (3380)
let us petition the court for access to these letters (3381)
smart (3382)
when do we get forensics blood work (3383)
preliminary 3 days (3384)
we should get an expedited necropsy on the dog (3385)
i think that is a cul de sac (3386)
no (3387)
preliminary m e report (3388)
shows no defensive wounds on the victim from a canine attack (3389)
yes but sweeney said (3390)
he heard no barking at all when the jane doe broke in (3391)
so maybe the attacker sedated the dog 1st (3392)
that would show up in a necropsy (3393)
you got a client (3394)
and if we can prove jane doe sedated the dog it is premeditation (3395)
she went there with the purpose of doing harm (3396)
good it is a place to start (3397)
get the letters and get the dog (3398)
alicia do you have a 2nd (3399)
cary would have done the same thing if he had that opportunity (3400)
i am sorry (3401)
i did not know i thought it was contracts (3402)
i never would have sent you there (3403)
will really it is fine (3404)
how are you handling it (3405)
the body the blood (3406)
good (3407)
i did not really think about it (3408)
what a weird life we lead huh (3409)
kalinda do not (3410)
so are we normal again are we dealing with it (3411)
we talking about the crime scene now (3412)
no (3413)
yes we are dealing with it (3414)
well welcome back (3415)
talk about the luck of job (3416)
on the brink of merging sweeney is company with another one (3417)
if this happens the merger is not off track yet (3418)
okay i will start (3419)
he likes you (3420)
i am so glad (3421)
you want me to translate (3422)
i understood every word (3423)
so do you come here a lot (3424)
my dad does (3425)
your dad who who is your dad (3426)
due to agency wide budget cuts the fbi has (3427)
if i tell you you promise not to freak out (3428)
okay not only do you have to tell me now (3429)
but nothing could top that introduction (3430)
ernesto cabrini (3431)
i do not know who that . (3432)
wait i do know who that is (3433)
he is the 4th richest man in europe right (3434)
3rd not that we are counting (3435)
so men freak out about that (3436)
only the ones who are uncomfortable (3437)
with their own masculinity yeah (3438)
si senor (3439)
what is your most expensive bottle of wine (3440)
to be very selective with its federal witness protection monies (3441)
so there is no pressure in this (3442)
it is just a deposition (3443)
they are polite and uncomplicated (3444)
they are just going to want basic information (3445)
no one is trying to score points (3446)
thank you (3447)
that is good all right good (3448)
cary everything all right (3449)
alicia hi how are you (3450)
 i am fine (3451)
how are you (3452)
i am good too (3453)
are you . (3454)
do you have a meeting with will (3455)
you have our proffer (3456)
no (3457)
did you talk to reception (3458)
no i am here for you (3459)
for me (3460)
yes the deposition (3461)
i am working with glenn childs now (3462)
yes very elegantly put (3463)
hi (3464)
how much money did your husband make last year (3465)
 last year (3466)
i do not know (3467)
my guess would be $55000 (3468)
and is it true that you took a vacation in antigua last february (3469)
unfortunately for my purposes i will need more specificity (3470)
yes (3471)
do you remember how much it cost (3472)
no $8545 and change (3473)
that madam is over 15% of your husband is yearly salary (3474)
i work too (3475)
yeah part time as a nurse (3476)
that is an additional 23 grand a year (3477)
just to save you time (3478)
cary we would stipulate (3479)
to mister arkin is involvement in the task force is corruption (3480)
yes (3481)
thank you missus florrick (3482)
i know that you would stipulate but i am looking to itemize (3483)
now let us turn to your domestic dispute charges against your husband (3484)
cute of the state is attorney (3485)
shows some unexpected wit (3486)
cary is a good lawyer (3487)
you think we made the wrong decision (3488)
not necessarily (3489)
jack arkin is (3490)
let us see how well he does against us (3491)
what is cary doing here (3492)
working for the opposition (3493)
smart (3494)
he is drawing blood too (3495)
part of a joint task force with the cook county sheriff is office (3496)
look i have some thoughts about finding this secret stash (3497)
good that could help us with a settlement (3498)
keep us informed (3499)
mister daley called (3500)
said he wanted to call peter before (3501)
but he was too busy (3502)
i knew exactly what he . (3503)
would you excuse me a 2nd (3504)
looking for a miss . (3505)
mister what was it again (3506)
goldman gold (3507)
missus florrick hello (3508)
he witnessed and was pressured to participate in illegal activities (3509)
i thought you might be able to help me with a little problem (3510)
well this is not really the place (3511)
yes unfortunately this is a time sensitive matter regarding your son (3512)
peter is questioning (3513)
whether to wait 4 years before running (3514)
no he is not (3515)
i am sorry he is (3516)
and if we do not file by the end of the week (3517)
we will be forced to wait 4 years (3518)
by other members of his drug task force (3519)
you are not lying (3520)
no (3521)
sorry i wish i were (3522)
pastor isaiah talked to him (3523)
who introduced him to this pastor (3524)
i did but not with that intention (3525)
mister gold there is one thing you need to know about my son (3526)
some of these activities crossed state lines (3527)
he is easily moved (3528)
you need to prescreen the people who see him (3529)
and i will talk to this man (3530)
plan on making the announcement by the end of the week (3531)
thank you (3532)
are you good mister gold (3533)
he is willing to help the fbi bring these corrupt cops to justice . (3534)
am i good (3535)
i am the best madam (3536)
i will need you to be (3537)
shalom (3538)
objection (3539)
plaintiff is counsel has an ongoing relationship with the expert witness (3540)
that seems more like a reason you should not hire him (3541)
than i should not question him (3542)
i am preserving my objection for trial (3543)
mister mcveigh (3544)
and save his own ass (3545)
on tuesday last did you conduct an experiment (3546)
duplicating the april 16th officer shooting (3547)
i did (3548)
and this experiment was conducted at your farm (3549)
it was (3550)
in your barn (3551)
yes and this experiment led to (3552)
your conclusion that the police investigation was accurate (3553)
that is correct (3554)
are you familiar with the fbi standards for ballistic investigation (3555)
i am (3556)
was this investigation in your barn in accordance with those standards (3557)
okay maybe this was a mistake (3558)
in most respects (3559)
so in some respects it was not (3560)
that would follow (3561)
so that would be a yes (3562)
you are correct (3563)
the assailant is firearm was lowered through the use of a c stand (3564)
yes (3565)
and the fbi standards caution (3566)
that a c stand is not a steady base for a firearm (3567)
all right all right (3568)
i believe that is correct (3569)
you believe (3570)
yes i believe (3571)
well then let us move on (3572)
in what other ways do your home spun (3573)
investigative methods clash with fbi standards (3574)
do you need a minute mister mcveigh (3575)
i understand internal affairs is investigating this task force (3576)
i am sorry (3577)
what are you looking for (3578)
these cell phone photos leave a date and time (3579)
there (3580)
saturday march 13 (3581)
why do not i just let them do their work (3582)
how does that help you (3583)
do you have your credit card bills (3584)
because the state is attorney wants to be reelected (3585)
he is not going to let an investigation (3586)
of his pet project become an embarrassment (3587)
i need to get into a storage locker (3588)
see how much fun it is being a fed (3589)
24 hour court orders (3590)
thank you (3591)
thanks (3592)
and what about the people in this room who could benefit (3593)
here we go (3594)
who you calling (3595)
lockhart gardner (3596)
something on your mind (3597)
let me see your phone (3598)
why (3599)
i want to see who you are phoning (3600)
from such an embarrassment (3601)
no (3602)
why (3603)
because i do not like to be questioned (3604)
mister arkin said there were 3 other corrupt cops (3605)
so we immediately put them under surveillance (3606)
this is you with a detective anthony burton (3607)
2 hours after our proffer (3608)
one hour before mister arkin was murdered (3609)
and here you are . (3610)
10 minutes later in his car (3611)
so (3612)
so kalinda . (3613)
there were only 5 of us in that room for that proffer (3614)
and one of us leaked (3615)
i will step out (3616)
0 so that is why these photos are so important (3617)
this one of me in the car (3618)
no the arkins came to you it is your case (3619)
cause it shows me leaking (3620)
it shows you in a compromised position (3621)
with a man (3622)
with a corrupt cop (3623)
and yet i phoned you to tell you about the stash did not i (3624)
which i would not do if i were compromised (3625)
true (3626)
i guess i could just be confused (3627)
good job kalinda (3628)
anything you can find to tie it to the task force would help (3629)
are you all right (3630)
you sound like you have been running (3631)
okay (3632)
something special (3633)
just an $8000 bottle of wine (3634)
a what (3635)
an $8000 bottle of wine (3636)
if you would not mind (3637)
so you are a kept man these days eh (3638)
i am working on it (3639)
missus florrick i think it is better to avoid any appearance of a conflict (3640)
you just said the opposite (3641)
no i did not madam (3642)
then i do not understand (3643)
well i can not help you with that (3644)
look we found your stash location (3645)
you saw the police investigative report (3646)
you saw the crime scene photos (3647)
so how did mister arkin is saliva end up (3648)
on the landing 2 feet away from his body (3649)
why do not we take a break no i think we are fine (3650)
do you have an answer mister hunter (3651)
you say you did not touch the body (3652)
so how did he end up on his back (3653)
i want to confer with counsel (3654)
if that will help you get to the truth (3655)
sure (3656)
okay no problem (3657)
mister hunter would like to adjust his testimony (3658)
adjust (3659)
let us adjust (3660)
i did move jack arkin is body (3661)
and why did you do that sir (3662)
jack was shot and fell face forward (3663)
i then after firing upon and killing mister gorman (3664)
proceeded to turn jack over onto his back (3665)
because he was wearing a wire trying to nail us (3666)
where is this wire (3667)
we gave it to internal affairs (3668)
this wire will be supplied to you (3669)
at the end of the business day today (3670)
and guess what lady (3671)
that wire that was supposed to catch us (3672)
it shows this thing went down exactly the way we said (3673)
so i will be waiting for your apology (3674)
you know what i would do if i were you alicia (3675)
i would prepare for a season of losing (3676)
so they are saying this supports their version of events (3677)
i hate to say it but i think it does (3678)
no does not matter if it supports it (3679)
what do you mean (3680)
look at the incident report (3681)
gorman was lying in wait gun in hands (3682)
and within seconds of arkin coming through the door (3683)
gorman was firing (3684)
so it was a setup (3685)
well the task force knew (3686)
arkin was the 1st one through the door (3687)
they did not need to kill arkin (3688)
they just needed gorman to do it (3689)
okay wrongful death is wrongful death (3690)
so let us look at gorman (3691)
did someone contact him check phone records (3692)
any acquaintance in common with hunter (3693)
please forgive the lateness people (3694)
we will get started (3695)
just come right in (3696)
there you go (3697)
and grab a seat make yourselves at at home (3698)
there you go there you go (3699)
missus florrick (3700)
pastor isaiah (3701)
how are you hello (3702)
what can i do for you (3703)
you can leave my son alone (3704)
will not you come in (3705)
you say you are a man of god (3706)
then stop making him feel this way (3707)
what way is that madam (3708)
like he is a bad man (3709)
he is a bad man (3710)
i am a bad man even you missus florrick (3711)
who do you think you are (3712)
you think you know people (3713)
giada alicia right (3714)
you just use the same words with everyone (3715)
y you just say god (3716)
and you think you can make people feel bad about themselves (3717)
missus florrick your son approached me (3718)
he asked advice from me (3719)
i will continue to offer that advice (3720)
and i will do everything in my power to stop you (3721)
you do not know my son (3722)
this is a phase you are a phase (3723)
yes are you waiting for someone (3724)
then we will see (3725)
no you will see (3726)
he is running this year (3727)
he is my blood and i do not know what your god does (3728)
but it does not match that (3729)
yeah will they told me i could wait down here (3730)
dinner (3731)
we are never getting out (3732)
let us do it (3733)
the 1st time we met (3734)
it was a pool party was not it (3735)
indoctrination or what do they call it (3736)
orientation (3737)
yeah it was a midnight pool party (3738)
0 he will be a while (3739)
about a 100 law students trying to impress each other (3740)
did you swim (3741)
no i was too shy (3742)
you were the one doing cannonballs (3743)
god that is so embarrassing (3744)
it was not at the time (3745)
so what did you think of me (3746)
no hello (3747)
ah no (3748)
0 that is okay (3749)
what (3750)
dangerous conversation (3751)
well now you have to tell me (3752)
come on i will tell you what i thought of you (3753)
so giada seems sweet (3754)
there is a segue (3755)
yes she is sweet (3756)
and 3rd year at depaul (3757)
yeah she is just getting her retainer out (3758)
you are a friend from college right (3759)
so is it always going to be this way between us (3760)
i want to say yes (3761)
but i want to know what you mean (3762)
just talking (3763)
of will is yes (3764)
being casual and blunt (3765)
i like myself around you alicia (3766)
i do not like myself around a lot of people (3767)
depaul 3rd year (3768)
you do (3769)
it is an act (3770)
it is perfected over a millennium (3771)
do not answer it (3772)
it is just life again (3773)
yes and that is why i have to (3774)
hello (3775)
0 you are in law school (3776)
kalinda what is up (3777)
no i am just with will (3778)
no (3779)
okay i will i will meet you there (3780)
hi (3781)
kalinda got the dealer gorman is phone records (3782)
the night of the shooting (3783)
he had 2 calls from a hank lydell (3784)
hank lydell who is hank lydell (3785)
no idea (3786)
kalinda checked no priors (3787)
i am going to meet her there (3788)
he talks a lot about you almost makes me jealous (3789)
okay (3790)
nice dinner (3791)
it was worth the wait (3792)
we always have options alicia (3793)
i am just saying (3794)
we have no idea who hank lydell is (3795)
or why he was urgently phoning a meth dealer (3796)
do not be (3797)
an hour before he killed a cop (3798)
it does not look like an addict is house (3799)
i do not think there is a look to an addict is house (3800)
what were you doing with will (3801)
having dinner (3802)
j k (3803)
thank you for waiting (3804)
mister lydell is right this way (3805)
that is very unlikely (3806)
hank has some good days (3807)
but his arthritis keeps him from dialing the phone (3808)
and you have never heard him talk about a man named gorman (3809)
no (3810)
who else has access to the phone (3811)
here any of us (3812)
just kidding (3813)
us (3814)
nursing care (3815)
hank has 24 hour nursing care (3816)
i have the graveyard shift (3817)
is there anyway to find out who was the nurse on duty (3818)
the night of the killing april 15th (3819)
that was trish (3820)
trish arkin (3821)
did i say something wrong (3822)
nice meeting you (3823)
no it is just that is the wife of the deceased (3824)
so our client did it (3825)
she apparently warned the meth dealer (3826)
that her husband was coming to arrest him (3827)
how did she even know him (3828)
apparently through the husband (3829)
and the rest of the task force (3830)
innocent (3831)
well we do not know that for sure (3832)
but it does look like it was just arkin (3833)
who was stashing the weapons and the drugs (3834)
he realized internal affairs was looking into him (3835)
so he thought he would make a deal and turn on his partners (3836)
and trish (3837)
she was a battered woman (3838)
did not want to enter witness relocation with her husband (3839)
well that explains the leak (3840)
when we counted who was in the room we did not count the wife (3841)
yep (3842)
and you want to hear an even greater irony (3843)
cook county wants to avoid embarrassment (3844)
they just made us an offer to drop the case (3845)
how much (3846)
a half a 1000000 (3847)
so trish gets her husband killed blames the police (3848)
and makes a cool half mill (3849)
are we taking it (3850)
well i do not think we can get them any higher (3851)
no i mean are we taking anything (3852)
she is guilty and she will get off (3853)
she is our client (3854)
it is our job (3855)
and at what point is our job wrong (3856)
when it fails our client (3857)
so let us advise our client to to accept the offer (3858)
that is hunter (3859)
he set up the drop house for the stash (3860)
so i seem to be a suspect (3861)
apparently internal affairs is looking into (3862)
my connection with the arkin shooting (3863)
yeah i heard (3864)
this stuff seems to be coming from your lawsuit (3865)
that is right (3866)
so why all the questions (3867)
about what i do for friends (3868)
what you thought i did it (3869)
that is brad (3870)
yeah (3871)
go to hell (3872)
he stashes the meth (3873)
what (3874)
what (3875)
nothing i just . (3876)
i am sorry (3877)
and foley he moves the guns (3878)
what is this (3879)
who really tipped off gorman (3880)
you have proof (3881)
12 mic check testing . (3882)
so is this just an exoneration victory lap (3883)
or is he going to announce (3884)
gail you will find out in one hour (3885)
0 come on (3886)
missus florrick going to be on stage with him (3887)
excuse me (3888)
this is gold (3889)
i do not know (3890)
they are not going to leave us alone the press (3891)
you are right (3892)
you know i was reading about these murals in sienna (3893)
and one of them showed good government (3894)
people happy (3895)
buildings going up (3896)
courts making good decisions (3897)
and on the opposite wall was bad government (3898)
it was the same people but they were . (3899)
they were unhappy (3900)
the courts were making bad decisions (3901)
it occurred to me (3902)
that it only works if people step up . (3903)
if you make the sacrifice (3904)
look i was just an okay state is attorney (3905)
nothing special (3906)
but i want to be a great one (3907)
and i can not do it without you (3908)
i do not want the kids involved (3909)
they will not be (3910)
and i want to work (3911)
i want you to work (3912)
and where is this (3913)
mister arkin at some risk to his own life (3914)
a little more than a year ago (3915)
i stood at this podium (3916)
and apologized to the public and to my family (3917)
about a personal failure (3918)
i made a very bad mistake (3919)
i betrayed my marital vows (3920)
hello will (3921)
took photos of the task force is drop house (3922)
alicia hi (3923)
where are you (3924)
peter is press conference (3925)
is everything all right (3926)
yes (3927)
i was just thinking i do not want to go through life (3928)
and think something did not happen just because i did not make myself clear (3929)
i can not hear you (3930)
i said i want to make something clear (3931)
hold on (3932)
all those charges were dropped (3933)
that puts me back where i belong (3934)
okay i just need to say it (3935)
we have been up and down back and forth (3936)
and i look at you alicia and i think that . (3937)
and he will gladly share the location upon receipt of an immunity deal (3938)
will . (3939)
no i just need to say this no (3940)
show me the plan (3941)
the what (3942)
the plan (3943)
i get the romance (3944)
i need a plan (3945)
not everything needs a plan (3946)
everything that matters does (3947)
i have 2 kids that mean the world to me (3948)
i have the press (3949)
they are just waiting for a whiff of a new scandal (3950)
and i have a husband (3951)
justice is what this job should be about (3952)
so if you want to cut through all that noise (3953)
then show me a plan (3954)
poetry is easy it is the parent teacher conferences that are hard (3955)
alicia come on (3956)

so do you like it (4035)
do i like what (4036)
stuff politics (4037)
i do not know (4038)
i like what it can do (4039)
i am sorry it is work (4040)
hello (4041)
no thanks (4042)
i am sorry . (4043)
no dessert (4044)
what is wrong (4045)
it is my client (4046)
0 officer down at 373 elmer driver (4047)
hey lady stop (4048)
 .00 officer down (4049)
all available units reporting to . (4050)
hey kalinda you can not be here (4051)
what happened out (4052)
out and i will tell you (4053)
dispatch we got an officer down (4054)
jack arkin is down i repeat jack arkin . (4055)
we raided this meth house and the shot came out of nowhere (4056)
top of the stairs (4057)
meth dealer named gorman (4058)
we had been following him around for 6 months (4059)
traded fire we took him down (4060)
why was jack through the door alone (4061)
he was not through the door alone we were there (4062)
just not fast enough right (4063)
you excuse me for a 2nd (4064)
i am sorry are you really blaming me for this leak (4065)
within 24 hours of our proffer our client was dead (4066)
yes and we are very saddened (4067)
but we can still get these corrupt cops off the street (4068)
by giving you the stash location (4069)
unfortunately he never gave the location to us (4070)
okay (4071)
let us just chalk this up as a bad 1st date (4072)
i am sorry to ask you this now (4073)
but you know our firm wants to file suit against cook county (4074)
and the city of chicago for wrongful death (4075)
yeah they phoned (4076)
i just do not want anyone to think i am profiting from this (4077)
we worry internal affairs will bury this (4078)
cause it is embarrassing to the state is attorney (4079)
give us a chance to investigate it (4080)
by bringing a lawsuit (4081)
yeah (4082)
so you think i should do this (4083)
i think bureaucracies are often prompted to action by the threat of money (4084)
the task force was targeting meth labs (4085)
their story is that arkin came through the door 1st (4086)
and then was shot by a meth dealer randy gorman (4087)
arkin ended up on his back here (4088)
then the rest of the task force returned fire killing gorman (4089)
but there is an inconsistency (4090)
lab found jack is blood mixed with his saliva (4091)
exactly 2 feet from the body here (4092)
suggesting (4093)
that he fell face 1st onto the landing (4094)
then someone flipped him over onto his back (4095)
it was staged (4096)
we will need ballistics i am on it (4097)
okay so our story is this (4098)
the task force discovered jack was going to testify (4099)
killed gorman (4100)
then used gorman is gun to kill jack (4101)
yeah let us finish this off in depositions (4102)
cook county will not want this in the press (4103)
you are hot on this (4104)
i am friends with a lot of cops (4105)
the bad ones hurt the good ones (4106)
so this is a crusade (4107)
it is a job (4108)
and a job i will do well (4109)
you will have to turn off cell phones and beepers (4110)
notice i am here as an invited guest (4111)
now that i am a client of your firm (4112)
yes (4113)
welcome (4114)
do you mind if i am blunt missus florrick (4115)
always a pleasure (4116)
i brought my business here i did not have to (4117)
do you mind if i am blunt mister gold (4118)
you brought your business here because we are a good firm (4119)
and let us both agree on one thing right now (4120)
they expect me on call (4121)
there is a statute of limitations on playing that card (4122)
fair enough (4123)
this is mimi collins (4124)
a 24 year old art student at whitley (4125)
2 years ago she was raped and brutally beaten (4126)
by her ex boyfriend a michael placedo (4127)
we will be 20 minutes at the most (4128)
well if this is a criminal matter (4129)
mister gold you can take it upstairs (4130)
no it is more of an allegory (4131)
placedo was sentenced to 20 years in prison (4132)
by the state is attorney at the time your husband (4133)
mimi collins went back to college (4134)
a happy healthy coed with nothing to fear (4135)
somehow i feel this will end badly (4136)
glenn childs in a general review of your husband is cases (4137)
argued that placedo be released with time served (4138)
that is mimi collins body (4139)
found 2 weeks ago in a chicago landfill (4140)
looks like your 1st ad campaign (4141)
it would be . (4142)
if it were not for the fact that peter has decided to wait 4 years to run (4143)
really (4144)
he said that at dinner with you and the kids (4145)
he was worried about the seductive allure of power (4146)
mister gold (4147)
who does the seductive allure of power sound like to you (4148)
that is right (4149)
the good pastor isaiah (4150)
i need you to talk to him (4151)
he thinks he is trying to restore your marriage (4152)
tell him you do not need that (4153)
always good to see you mister gold (4154)
peter can not win without you (4155)
you know that (4156)
peter only wins with your good housekeeping seal of approval (4157)
i can not believe we are doing this (4158)
voters need to see you together (4159)
up on that stage holding hands (4160)
good bye mister gold (4161)
mister gorman got off 3 rapid shots (4162)
on the task force lead man your client mister arkin (4163)
all hit their target center 2 high one low (4164)
and this matches the crime scene (4165)
no my stairwell is 2 steps taller (4166)
i have adjusted by lowering the c stand (4167)
we could still turn back (4168)
now mister arkin fell as he was firing here on the landing (4169)
while another member of the task force (4170)
rushed in and fired 3 shots from here (4171)
you all right yes (4172)
what does it say about me that i find this exhilarating (4173)
you are human (4174)
and are we saying that the task force (4175)
then planted a drop gun on mister gorman or or was it his (4176)
it was his (4177)
well so how did this . (4178)
i mean are you saying . (4179)
i love you (4180)
you are saying it happened the way the police said (4181)
yes (4182)
it was not staged (4183)
that is correct (4184)
and the . (4185)
and the blood and saliva stain (4186)
you do not think mister arkin was flipped over onto his back (4187)
no my guess is that in the extremity of the moment (4188)
one of mister arkin is partners (4189)
turned him on his back to check his vitals (4190)
and they failed to report this during the investigation (4191)
you seem to accord the police a great deal of honesty (4192)
i do (4193)
and you brought me out here to what (4194)
your firm asked me to examine the evidence (4195)
well we have asked you that before and you just said no (4196)
that is true (4197)
it is because of my feelings for you (4198)
that i have shown you this (4199)
i will not bill you for the effort (4200)
your feelings for me (4201)
i was approached by the state is attorney is office (4202)
to argue against our lawsuit (4203)
we are redoing the floors (4204)
yes (4205)
i declined (4206)
i think you should do what you want kurt (4207)
i think you should testify for the state is attorney is office (4208)
i would not hesitate to argue against you (4209)
let me think about it (4210)
i will go get my purse (4211)
yo . (4212)
so here we are (4213)
dinner and i am treating (4214)
damn right you are (4215)
i ran into alicia florrick (4216)
huh where (4217)
at the office she seems nice (4218)
yes and a very talented lawyer (4219)
i am sure (4220)
i felt like i was intruding (4221)
you felt like you were intruding (4222)
i do not understand that (4223)
i felt like i was getting checked out by someone who had skin in the game (4224)
senorita cabrini (4225)
